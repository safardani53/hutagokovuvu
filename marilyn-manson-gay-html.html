While the lyrics of his songs have often made him a target for media and politics, he has also garnered the love of millions of fans all over the world. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Back in 1999, Manson was on the receiving end of a lot of negative attention when the media blamed him in the wake of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Columbine High School massacre</a></p><p>His music was seen as the thing that instigated the duo,&nbsp;Eric David Harris and Dylan Bennet Klebold,&nbsp;to violence.&nbsp;It seemed natural to many as Manson's&nbsp;songs appealed to alienated individuals and those who had&nbsp;trouble fitting in. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Manson Was Bullied Because Other Kids Thought He Was Gay</h2><p>Manson’s songs have a dark tone to them, often involving matters relating to sex, death, and teenage alienation. The singer has always been open about the things that shaped his lyrics.</p><p>He had a difficult childhood that was further exacerbated by an unhealthy upbringing. His father was a Vietnam veteran and when he returned from the war zone, he had brought about the aftereffects of years of violence and war.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>‘The Beautiful People’ singer found it increasingly difficult to navigate life when he was sent to a Christian school he hated. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He couldn’t fit in with the others, as he was frequently <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">beaten up</a> by other kids who thought he was gay. There, he developed a deep loathing for religious dogma. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>That might have been one reason for Manson’s controversial statements about Christ, his love for satanism, and his bizarre and debatable practices during his performances on stage.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In fact, Manson <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">says</a> the reason he created his alter ego and started performing was because he couldn’t fit in. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>I think one of the reasons I got on stage was because I have a hard time relating to people.It was a matter of being invisible as a kid. I didn’t have to create an alter-ego, I had to create an ego because I didn’t have anywhere I could be.</p><p>Manson’s feelings of alienation didn’t seem to abate for a long time and his music continued to reflect his fears and his suicide ideation. He previously revealed that he used to have extremely disturbing nightmares where he would die, hence the recurring theme of death in his songs.</p><h2>Manson And His Parents</h2><p>For a long time, the eponymous rock band’s frontman had a rocky relationship with his parents, only reconciling much later. Eventually, the three grew close, and he moved them to California, where he could support them much easier.</p><p>Manson’s mother developed Alzheimer’s later in life and died after a 13 year-long battle with dementia at 68 years of age on May 13, 2014. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The musician married Dita Von Teese, the Queen of Burlesque, on December 3, 2005, and divorced two years later on December 29, 2007. She revealed the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reason</a> for their separation to be infidelity and drug abuse. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinqKhdmMKtwNSrnGilkae2rcXNZqSapqOku26zwLJloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
