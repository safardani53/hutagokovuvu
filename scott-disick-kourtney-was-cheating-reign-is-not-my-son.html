At the time, Scott didn’t question whether he was the father, but that soon changed,” explains the source.</p><p>“It didn’t take long for Scott to start having doubts as to whether Reign is actually his child.”</p><p>The source adds that Disick became deeply concerned in response remarks made by family and friends:</p><p>“What really got under Scott’s skin is when family members said that Reign didn’t look like him,” says the insider.</p><p>“Penelope and Mason are dead ringers for Scott, but Reign looks more like Kourtney.”</p><p>The insider says that in the months before Reign was conceived, Scott and Kourtney often spent long stretches of time apart.</p><p>“There were countless times when they’d split up and not see each other for weeks. And whenever they had a huge argument,” says the source.</p><p>The informant claims that during that time, Kourtney often “went out of her way to seek revenge. She’d often party with her pals and close guy friends.”&nbsp;</p><p>Scott has reportedly addressed these concerns with Kourtney, but it seems she refuses to acknowledge his suspicions.</p><p>“Kourtney didn’t want to hear it when Scott asked if he’s really the father,” says the insider.</p><p>“She outright denied [that Reign could be someone else’s],” the source adds.</p><p>“During the heated bust-up, Scott brought up doing a DNA test. Kourtney said no, which has only heightened his suspicions.”</p><p>So it seems the matter will remain a mystery–unless, of course, Kris Jenner can talk Kourtney into doing a DNA test for TV ratings.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>The Good, The Bad, The Lord: 23 Times Scott Disick Owned Reality TV</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2Z%2FcL%2FCqKutZZSewKqvymaiqK2iqbumxYywmKxlk52yosDIp55mqpWetK95yKxkp6ekYrq6edKopWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lauren-harpe-wiki-whats-her-ethnicity-family-and-religion-explore.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lauren Harpe Wiki: Whats Her Ethnicity?
