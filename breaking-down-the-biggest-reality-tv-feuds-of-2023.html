As a result, cameras captured more footage for a new season finale that included <a href=#>details about the drama</a>.</p><p>Sandoval and Raquel subsequently found themselves on the outs with most of their costars as <a href=#>everyone rallied around Ariana</a>. After hashing out their issues at the reunion special later that month, Raquel checked herself into a mental health facility and <a href=#>confirmed her exit</a> from the show.</p><p><strong>Lala Kent</strong> referred to Raquel’s decision as a “travesty” once they wrapped <a href=#>production on season 11</a>.</p><p>“She should have come back. I think she would have been very surprised,” Lala said on an August episode of the “Give Them Lala” podcast. “I don’t think that reality TV is for everyone. It is a very intense environment. If you are not mentally tough as f—k, it can break you. It definitely can. Now to say that Raquel was a victim of something, I don’t know. What I do know is you made a decision to sleep with your best friend’s partner of 10 years. You didn’t need to do that. No one was forcing you to do it and no one asked you to do that.”</p><p>Sandoval, for his part, returned for season 11 and seemingly was able to <a href=#>get to a better place</a> with several costars as the tide started to turn. The trailer for the upcoming season, which starts airing on Bravo in January 2024, <a href=#>hinted at a reconciliation</a> between Sandoval and <strong>Scheana Shay</strong>.</p><p>Meanwhile, over at Netflix, various <a href=#>Selling Sunset</a> stars were at odds across two seasons. <strong>Chrishell Stause</strong> and <strong>Nicole Young</strong> <a href=#>kicked off their feud</a> during season 6. Nicole accused Chrishell of only getting real estate listings because their boss <strong>Jason Oppenheim</strong> had a crush on her, which caused Chrishell to fire back.</p><p>Fellow Oppenheim Group employees <strong>Chelsea Lazkani</strong> and <strong>Bre Tiesi</strong> also had several disagreements when Chelsea shared her concerns about the newcomer <a href=#>raising a child with <strong>Nick Cannon</strong></a> — who has multiple children with six different women.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Both Selling Sunset feuds <a href=#>remained unresolved</a> by the end of the show’s seventh season.</p><p>Scroll through for a look back at the biggest reality TV feuds of the year:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BXv6atyqKloGWUpMSvedOhnGaamZy0pr%2FTZqmemZyewbp5069kn52lmcBuu8VmaWlqY2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fashion-mum-cool.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I'm fashion pro &amp;amp; what mums should be wearing at the school gates - it will stop you looking boring</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./braxton-berrios-and-alix-earle-relationship-timeline-7561003.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Braxton Berrios and Alix Earle's Relationship Timeline</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
