Since then, there have been various adaptations of the classic story, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Steven Spielberg</a>'s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>2021 retelling</a> starring <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Rachel Zegler</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Ansel Elgort</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Inspired by Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, the plot details the rise and fall of two young lovers from different backgrounds amid cultural tensions and gang violence. Set in the 1950s, the Sharks are a Puerto Rican group that feuds with the Jets, an American gang, over control of the Upper West Side of New York City.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Rita Moreno in <i>West Side Story</i>.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Silver Screen Collection/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The original 1961 cast includes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Natalie Wood</a>, Richard Beymer, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Russ Tamblyn</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Rita Moreno</a>, and George Chakiris.

It holds the record for the most wins for a musical and was the second-highest-grossing film in the U.S. that same year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to a slew of high praise from critics and viewers, "the film has been deemed 'culturally significant' by the United States Library of Congress and was selected for the National Film Registry in 1997," noted on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>official West Side Story site</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>West Side Story.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's where the original 1961 cast of West Side Story is today.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-natalie-wood-as-maria></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Natalie Wood as Maria</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Silver Screen Collection/Getty; Ron Galella Collection via Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wood played the lead female character of Maria in 1961's West Side Story. Maria is compared to Shakespeare's Juliet who falls in love with Tony's Romeo. She's the younger sister of Bernardo, who's head of the Puerto Rican Sharks, yet finds herself at a controversial crossroad because Tony leads the rival Jets gang.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wood shot to stardom at age 16 for her famed role in 1955's Rebel Without a Cause, co-starring alongside James Dean and Sal Mineo. 1961 was a big year for the actress who starred in two Oscar-nominated films: Splendor in the Grass and West Side Story. In 1962, she played the title role in Gypsy, the musical about stripper Gypsy Rose Lee.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress had relationships with many notable names over the years including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Dennis Hopper</a>, hotel dynasty heir Nicky Hilton and even singer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Elvis Presley</a>. Wood placed her focus on family after remarrying actor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Robert Wagner</a> in 1972 and having a daughter in 1974.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple remained together until <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Wood died at age 43 in 1981</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rachel Zegler plays the role of Maria in Spielberg's revival.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-richard-beymer-as-tony></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Richard Beymer as Tony</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Artists/Kobal/Shutterstock; Ron Galella Collection via Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Beymer played Tony, the male lead in 1961's West Side Story, who falls in love with Maria after their first encounter.

Hollywood was a thing of the past for me because I'd found something that thrilled me," he told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Los Angeles Times</a> in 1990.

"They offered me the part of Riff, and I took it!" He added, "Oddly enough, I've never gotten anything I've ever auditioned for."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prior to West Side Story, he appeared in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954) and earned an Oscar nomination for his supporting role in Peyton Place (1957).

"One day before we actually started rehearsals, I looked at the score and there it is… 'Puerto Rico, you ugly island.
