Magazine. “They’ve known for a long time that they wanted kids, but always thought of it as something they would do down the line — but then they shot this movie and they started imagining being parents together.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>According to a source on the set of Breaking Dawn Part 2, Kristen and Rob couldn’t keep quiet about their plans to have a baby during rehearsals. “They would talk a lot about having a baby and all of their feelings about what sort of parents they’d like to be,” the source shared.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The couple is so eager to have kids together, they wouldn’t mind if Kristen got pregnant before their wedding planned for the fall! “They don’t have to wait for a ceremony to start planning a family — and that’s exactly what they plan to do,” a family friend told OK!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Kristen’s family is totally cool with the idea of Rob and Kristen starting a family so soon! “When Kristen told her family that she may not wait to get married before having Rob’s children, they were thrilled,” a family friend reveals. “They didn’t mind at all. Kristen’s mom and dad, John and Jules, are old hippies from way back and don’t believe their daughter needs to marry first before having babies. Rob is thrilled that Kristen’s parents approve.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>If Kristen did become pregnant before the wedding, their fall wedding would be moved up and downsized. “They’ve hinted at even eloping and doing a quickie wedding,” says a family pal. The pal also shared that Kristen and Rob feel like they’re already married anyway.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Adoption is also an option the couple definitely wants to explore. Kristen has two adopted brothers of her own and and would like to adopt after having a baby of her own with Rob. “[I]t’s something she’s always wanted to do,” a source reveals. “And Rob is all for it, he just loves the idea of having a family.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Now that the couple has realized how much they want to be parents, they are going to let things happen naturally and see what happens. “They’re not exactly trying — but they’re also not doing anything to prevent it. They know they want to spend their lives together and they’re kind of like, ‘Well, if it happens, it happens.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Kristen thinks that Rob will make a great father, so of course she can’t wait to have a baby with him! “Rob’s really good with [kids],” Kristen gushed about her British beau. “Every time they started crying, I would be worried about the baby. I’d go, ‘Oh, God, where’s its mom?’ And he would literally go into the corner and rock it to sleep.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Rob has even started writing lullabies for his future baby with Kristen! “Every time he gets his custom-made guitar out, Rob will start strumming lullabies and making up silly baby songs. It’s really sweet,” shared a friend.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>HollywoodLifers,</strong>&nbsp;do you think Kristen and Rob will make great parents?</p><h3>— Jenny Pickard</h3><p id=content-paragraph-12><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Check Us Out On Pinterest!</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong>More Rob and Kristen news:</strong></p><li>Robert Pattinson & Kristen Stewart’s Romantic Wedding Date — PICS</li><li>Kristen Stewart Greets Fan On Robert Pattinson Date — Cute Pic</li><li>Robert Pattinson & Kristen Stewart’s Romantic Date At Jenny Lewis Concert</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWliZH13e5FwZqSqmajBprqMrKuer5GnwW6%2Bzpucq6xdpa61wMinqqimXZeuo8WMqamen56Wu7V5waucmqOZo7RusMCwpWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stars-daisy-dukes-photos-celebrities-denim-shorts-winter.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Photos Of Celebrities In Denim Shorts In Winter Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dangelo-russells-girlfriend-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>DAngelo Russells Girlfriend: Who is DAngelo Russell Dating?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
