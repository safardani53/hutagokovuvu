She looks a decent each-way price.</p><p>Thatswhatshesaid is another newcomer who comes from a nice jumping family and is worth a look in the betting.</p><p>12.30</p><p>FINDTHETIME was a good winner at Wetherby two runs ago over this trip before being badly hampered when fourth at Doncaster latest.</p><p>Coming back to this distance is a plus and he has every chance from a 3lb higher mark than his latest success.</p><p>Gardener had 30 lengths in hand when scoring on debut at Southwell 20 days ago.</p><p>He didn’t have a lot to beat but couldn’t have been more impressive and should be open to improvement.</p><p>He handles soft ground and trainer Olly Murphy is in decent form.</p><p>Champ De Gane keeps finishing second and has moved yards since his runner-up effort at Perth latest. He needs to improve but is on a fair weight.</p><p>Halfway House Lad hasn’t shown anything like enough to figure even after his wind op.</p><p>1.05</p><p>JUGE ET PARTI loves a slog in the mud as he showed when winning at Hexham last time.</p><p>He won’t mind this step up in distance and Newcastle in soft ground is a proper stamina test that he should relish.</p><p>Teescomponentstrig was a place behind the tip in that race and is another who will relish conditions at a track where he’s scored before.</p><p>Artic Mann has shown promise on both runs since coming back from two years off. He stayed well enough at Kelso latest and will be boxing on at the finish.</p><p>Space Voyage is taking a fair drop in class after tackling a Listed contest at Kempton.</p><p>He went close off this mark at Wincanton in November and is another to note.</p><p>The Vollan is hit and miss but has enough talent to figure on a going day.</p><p>1.40</p><p>TWO AULD PALS was a winner on the Flat and made a good start to his hurdling career when a close-up second at Bangor last time.</p><p>He might have won but for a late mistake and should have learned from the experience.</p><p>Forged Well jumped badly right on debut at Carlisle but still managed to run out an easy winner.</p><p>He may cross his hurdles better with that run under his belt and can figure again despite a 7lb penalty.</p><p>Konfusion has hit the frame on both starts and shapes like a stamina test will be ideal. He has been off 543 days but should be suited by conditions.</p><p>Lunar Chief won a bumper here in the mud but has been a little disappointing over hurdles so far. He can figure if brushing up his jumping.</p><p>2.15</p><p>HANDSTANDS looks hard to beat after lagging in on debut at Hereford last month.</p><p>He looked green but travelled strongly and jumped well. He should take another step forward with that under his belt.</p><p>Boolamore Classic comes from a decent jumping family and is worth a market check on this debut.</p><p>Rock Steady Eddie showed some promise when third on his bumper debut at Hexham in October.</p><p>He enjoyed the testing ground and has an each-way shout.</p><p>Mayheblucky did well in point-to-points and is another who could make the frame on debut.</p><p>Raffles Wonder won a bumper but has struggled over timber.</p><p>2.50</p><p>EMPTY NEST finished like a train when beaten a head at Catterick last time.</p><p>He hit the first fence which put him on the back foot but he generally jumped well and Newcastle’s long straight should be right up his street.</p><p>Goodoldbill saw out three miles well to score in a photo here last time and his stamina will be an asset in the testing conditions.</p><p>A 3lb rise in the weights looks fair and he’s right in the mix again.</p><p>Coolkill looked much improved from his hurdling days when second back over fences at Musselburgh. He is another thorough stayer who has place claims.</p><p>Attention All showed some promise on chase debut at Carlisle and has had a nudge down the weights. He needs more but could make the frame.</p><p>Carrigeen Castle was well beaten at Hexham but jumped well and could show more.</p><p>3.25</p><p>GLORY HIGHTS is worth a squeak at a big price on handicap debut.</p><p>This race looks wide open and trainer Chris Grant has plenty of winners at Newcastle. He starts from a low mark and should be be open to improvement.</p><p>Yealand was a fair fourth at Bangor latest and is another who should improve now handicapping. He handles testing ground well.</p><p>Robert D’Ores was going like the winner when unseating two from home over fences at Hexham.</p><p>That was much improved form and he’s interesting back over the smaller obstacles.</p><p>Tommy Johnson wasn’t disgraced at Catterick latest when showing plenty of stamina.</p><p>Trainer Mark Walford is in decent form and he’s on the shortlist in what look a poor contest.</p><p>WINCANTON</p><p>12.20</p><p>HEROS DE ROMAY has improved with every run and battled right to the line when winning at Chepstow last time.</p><p>He relished the testing ground at that tough track and this challenge should be right up his street.</p><p>Lord Of Thunder was impressive when scoring here by 10 lengths last month. He travelled strongly and should be suited by this longer trip. It should be a good battle between the pair.</p><p>Paddy De Pole wasn’t asked too many questions when a distant third at Chepstow on debut. He should show a lot more with that under his belt.</p><p>Casual Observer showed a little promise on debut at Market Rasen but needs a fair step forward for in-form trainer Harry Derham.</p><p>12.55</p><p>MAJESTIC JAMEELA was an impressive winner at Leicester before aiming slightly too high when fourth in a hot Listed contest at Newbury.</p><p>She handles testing ground well and likes this trip so can get her head back in front.</p><p>Fresh Kiss is an interesting hurdles recruit from France where she won four times on the Flat.</p><p>Jamie Snowden will have her ready for this UK debut.</p><p>Mairis Icon took a step forward when fourth here latest on handicap debut. She enjoyed this trip on testing ground and has place claims again.</p><p>Bethpage hasn’t shown a lot so far but it’s earlier days and she’s bred for this game so should improve.</p><p>1.30</p><p>MAGIC SAINT has been given a break since his poor run at Newton Abbot in June and he was a winner on his last run over this course and distance.</p><p>He handles soft ground and should show his true form.</p><p>Fast Buck has been running in hotter races than this with little success but should find things easier here.</p><p>Mr Grey Sky won well twice before making errors at Newbury latest which gives him a few questions to answer while Prince Quali should be fitter for his comeback here latest.</p><p>2.05</p><p>ONE LAST GLANCE came back from 20 months off with a close second at Lingfield in November.</p><p>He looks on a fair handicap mark with his rider taking off a valuable 5lb.</p><p>Feach Amach relished the deep ground when slogging to victory at Sedgefield latest. This is hotter but she should be capable of better.</p><p>Daany is hit and miss and will be happier back down in trip here on ground he handles as a son of Pivotal.</p><p>Angel’s Dream put in an improved effort when fourth at Plumpton and has had a little nudge down the weights.</p><p>Western Soldier has struggled on both handicap starts, while Fourofakind was held at Exeter but his yard is in excellent form now so he could show more.</p><p>2.40</p><p>HUELGOAT got a poor ride by top-class Harry Cobden’s own admission at Sandown last time and he’ll be happier down in trip and grade here.</p><p>Freddie Gingell was on board when they scored at Wincanton two runs ago and his 5lb claim will come in handy today.</p><p>Georges Saint has landed two impressive wins in the mud at Fakenham and Ffos Las. He’s now 7lb higher for the most recent success but he’s improving fast and looks a big threat.</p><p>Iconic Muddle is back from a break but is down the weights and has shown his best at this trip. He can make his presence felt.</p><p>Jacamar ran up to his best when second at Wincanton but needs a bit more in this company.</p><p>3.15</p><p>INTIMATE should have won at Uttoxeter last time when the door was slammed in his face halfway up the run-in.</p><p>He finished full of running and looks on a fair mark for this handicap debut. This trip and soft ground suit.</p><p>Individualiste didn’t break sweat when scoring at Taunton and should be ahead of the handicapper. He has won in bottomless ground and rates the big danger.</p><p>Bumpy Johnson won his last hurdles race and can do better than his past two chase efforts.</p><p>Astronomic View is a real stayer who ran well at Bangor latest. He will be doing his best work at the finish.</p><p>Don’t Rightly Know needs a bit more than his Wincanton second last time out.</p><p>3.50</p><p>PERCY VEERING got the better of Caeruleum at Exeter last time and can confirm the form despite being 5lb worse off at the weights.</p><p>He made it three wins in a row and has the race sewn up a long way out.</p><p>It should be a goºd battle between them but Kim Bailey’s hopeful can come out on top again.</p><p>Haston Clermont enjoyed himself at Lingfield last time when scoring over three miles. A 5lb rise in the weights looks fair and he’ll be competitive again.</p><p>Galway Mahler was third in that contest at Leafy after tiring near the line and his stamina will be stretched again in these conditions.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Templegate's tips and Irish selections</h2><p>Cork</p><p>12.12 Paggane<br>12.47 Flamborough<br>1.22 Largy Hill<br>1.57 Abbeydale (NAP)<br>2.32 Aghmorough Bridge<br>3.07 R'evelyn Pleasure (nb)<br>3.42 Cathedral Rocks</p><h4 class=has-text-align-center id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here><a href=# aria-label="FREE BETS - GET THE BEST SIGN UP DEALS AND RACING OFFERS (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">FREE BETS - GET THE BEST SIGN UP DEALS AND RACING OFFERS</a></h4><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
