He was able to rebuild his career after the scandal.</p><p>Following the scandal Brian was demoted from chief anchor of NBC’s Nightly News to breaking news anchor for MSNBC.</p><h2>BRIAN'S LIES</h2><p>In 2015, Williams was suspended by NBC for six months without pay, and replaced by Lester Holt, for the Iraq helicopter crash story.</p><p>The scandal erupted when Williams claimed that a helicopter he was on during the Iraq War had been hit by enemy fire and forced down.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>Veterans from a convoy that had accompanied the news anchor at the time challenged his story, which he had repeated in the past, on Facebook.&nbsp;</p><h2>NOT THE FIRST TIME</h2><p>It emerged that it wasn’t the first time Williams had embellished the Iraq story.</p><p>He was also accused of making up a story about seeing a body floating in front of his hotel in the French Quarter of New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina.</p><p>It was claimed by an official speaking to The New Orleans Advocate, that that the Quarter was mostly dry at the time.</p><p>After Williams embellishments emerged, NBC News President Deborah Turness&nbsp;said in a memo: "While on Nightly News on Friday, January 30, 2015, Brian misrepresented events which occurred while he was covering the Iraq War in 2003. It then became clear that on other occasions Brian had done the same while telling that story in other venues.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000150419253-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000625854662.jpg><p>"This was wrong and completely inappropriate for someone in Brian's position. As Managing Editor and anchor of Nightly News, Brian has a responsibility to be truthful and to uphold the high standards of the news division at all times," she said.</p><h2>ALLISON DEFENDS HER DAD</h2><p>Williams is the father of Girls star Allison Williams, who spoke out to defend her dad after the scandal hit headlines.</p><p>Speaking in an interview with Seth Meyers, Allison, 33, assured the audience that the longtime anchor could be trusted.</p><p>"This has been a really hard time. We have also been feeling very lucky, counting our blessings. We have our health. We have each other. It's been incredible to experience the outreach from people you love, family, friends, and then people we don't even know, strangers, just reaching out saying we want him back on TV," the HBO star said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000692636261.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000692636251.jpg><p>Allison added, "It's been tough, though -- obviously toughest on my dad, who's bearing the full burden of responsibility for it."&nbsp;</p><p>"My dad has always been there for us 100 percent of the time, even sometimes before we knew we needed him. And so this, to be here for him, is the least we can do," she explained.</p><p>"One thing the experience has not done is shake my trust and belief in him as a man. He's a really good man. He's an honest man. He's a truthful man. He has so much integrity. He cares so much about journalism. And yes, he's a really good dad," she said. "I know you can trust him because, as any good daughter does, I've tested him on that."</p><h2>INTERVIEW WITH MATT LAUER</h2><p>Williams sat down for an interview with his colleague Matt Lauer to address the incident, saying he owned his failure and had let his ego get in the way of the truth.</p><p>“I said things that weren’t true,” he told Lauer - who himself was <a href=#>embroiled in a scandal</a> two years later - “I let down my NBC colleagues and our viewers, and I’m determined to earn back their trust.”</p><h2>BRIAN'S ANNOUNCEMENT</h2><p>The anchorman announced the news on Tuesday, expressing his gratitude to NBC.</p><p>“This is the end of a chapter and the beginning of another,” said&nbsp;<a href=#>Wiliams</a>&nbsp;in a statement. “There are many things I want to do, and I’ll pop up again somewhere.”</p><p>Williams has anchored The 11th Hour for the past 5 years. He thanked his audience for their “loyal” viewing of the show and says the program will “remain in good hands.”</p><p>Williams was key in the launch of the MSNBC news channel in 1996 and became a well-known figure as part of NBC Nightly News.</p><p>Williams was able to rebuild his career after the scandal and earn the trust of his viewers once again.</p><p>“28 years, 38 countries, 8 Olympic games, 7 Presidential elections, half a dozen Presidents, a few wars, and one SNL,” said Williams of his career.</p><p>A source close to Williams claims that the anchorman was offered a new contract by NBC however it’s unclear why he declined it.</p><h2>FAMILY TIME</h2><p>Reportedly Williams, now a free agent for the first time in nearly 30 years, will be taking the chance to spend&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">more time with his family</a>&nbsp;including his wife Jane and two children.</p><p>“I will reflect on the kindness people have shown me, and I will pay it forward,” he said.</p><p>In 1986, Williams married TV producer Jane Stoddard Williams.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Their daughter, Allison Williams, starred on the HBO comedy Girls and in the film Get Out.</p><p>Their son, Doug Williams, is the late-night anchor of Geico SportsNite, which airs on the regional New York metropolitan area channel SportsNet&nbsp;<a href=#>New York</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000692635909.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000625854661-1.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>News presenter Brian Williams suspended after confessing on air that he'd lied about being on a helicopter when it was shot down</span><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsYGiCdn%2BRaJmroZGjeri1y6WgmqWjYsCkrc2dmKWrXZ2yrbXCqKetnaJiuaqxjKqsoqyjYrq0usGcZKeak2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./morgan-freeman-falls-asleep-during-live-interview-2013235.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Morgan Freeman Falls Asleep During Live Interview: Video</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ella-purnell.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ella Purnell Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
