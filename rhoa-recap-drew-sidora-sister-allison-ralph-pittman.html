She further explained, “Allison and Ralph were really butting heads, and she made some pretty serious accusations about Ralph being controlling and manipulative, so for that reason, she was banned from our home for a few years.” Drew didn’t reveal whether or not she agreed with Ralph’s decision to keep Allison away from their house, but based on the fact that Drew tried persuading him that everything would be okay when she stepped back inside their house, we’d say she probably wasn’t fond of the choice he made all those years ago.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Later in the episode, when Allison arrived at the house late at night, Ralph was already upstairs sleeping. “Ralph went to bed knowing Allison would be here soon,” Drew said in her private confessional. “I want us to be a family, and I want us both as a united front to support her on her journey of healing. So, to dismiss himself, I don’t really feel it’s the right choice.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#RHOA</a> Season 15, Episode 8 SNEAK PEEK 2.

I wanted to see exactly how she would be during [the music video shoot], and I felt she was extremely supportive.
