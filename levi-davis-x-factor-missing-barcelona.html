He had his backpack with him," she told our reporter.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>There was live music at the venue that night and Levi had his pint watching the Liverpool vs Leeds game on TV.</p><p>"He seemed normal. He didn't stay long and left around 10pm," she added.</p><p>The bartender, who declined to be named, tells us that she had given a statement to the police as part of the probe.</p><p>Her account casts doubt on the theory he was living in fear while being hunted by a gang.</p><p>His backpack - which contained his beloved laptop that he used as a mobile music studio - has never been found.</p><p>His phone also remains missing - but appears to have been accessed after he vanished - and his bank cards have not been used.</p><p>Little is known about Levi’s movements after leaving the Old Irish Pub.</p><p>The only trace of Levi was his passport - which was discovered 20 days later in Barcelona Port.</p><p>And so, The Sun Online followed Levi's footsteps to try and find any information on what may have happened - with serious questions being asked about the effectiveness of the police response.</p><p>Our reporter started from sunny Ibiza where Levi spent two weeks staying with his close friend Richard Squire while on a break following a knee injury.</p><p>The former Bath winger had told Squire he was going to see some friends&nbsp;in the Catalan capital but he disappeared just hours after arriving on the Spanish mainland.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/investigation-disappearance-former-rugby-player-806595999.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sun-online-investigation-disappearance-former-804100499.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sun-online-investigation-disappearance-former-804100603.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sun-online-investigation-disappearance-former-804100873.jpg><p>After tracking him down on the island, he hit out at "rubbish theories" surrounding his disappearance - such as the involvement of Somali gangs - but declined to comment further.</p><p>It's a chilly sunny day in March and our journey begins exactly where Levis' started - at the Ibiza Town port at 10 am.</p><p>We are travelling on a Balearia ferry- the same Levi used for the eight-hour trip to Barcelona.</p><p>As it's not peak tourist season, there is only a handful of us travelling on foot - it seems that those who opt to travel by ferry either need to transport their vehicle or want to avoid the cost of a last-minute flight.</p><p>We go up to the top deck - and stand nearly exactly where Levi recorded a <a href=#>strange garbled video message</a> which he sent to his mum, Julie Davis.</p><p>"Hi mum... it's beautiful," said Levi.</p><p>And then we visited the bar, where we spoke to staff - asking if they had any memories of Levi.</p><p>Sadly, the crew on our sailing did not as most of them were "new" - but one woman commented such as a tall, muscular young man would be hard to miss even in a crowd.</p><p>We immediately become familiar with the other passengers in the modest lounge and on the deck during the eight-hour crossing.</p><p>It strikes our reporter that someone <strong>must</strong> have seen Levi.</p><p>And yet as far as we are aware, no one from his ferry on the morning of October 29 has come forward to say they've seen him - despite a <a href=#>desperate plea from his family</a>.</p><p>The long trip comes to its end at around 7pm and the boat docks in Barcelona.</p><p>Unlike Ibiza's sleepy off-season port, Barcelona's harbour is bustling with life.</p><p>It's also where <a href=#>Levi's passport was discovered </a>near a cargo shipment almost three weeks after he went missing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sun-online-investigation-disappearance-former-804101323.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sun-online-investigation-disappearance-former-804100996.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sun-online-investigation-disappearance-former-804100969.jpg><p>There is a two-hour gap between his arrival in Barcelona and his last sighting at the Old Irish Pub in Las Ramblas.</p><p>It's about an hour's walk from the port to The Old Irish Pub - so probably unlikely Levi had gone there on foot.</p><p>Whether the young man met with someone, walked nearly an hour to the city centre or got a taxi remains a mystery.</p><p>Chatting to the taxi driver on the way, he tells us he is familiar with the case - with it being often featured on talk radio.</p><p>"Las Ramblas is a dodgy place for tourists," he warns us as he drops us off near where Levi was last seen.</p><p>And indeed, while walking through the bustling tourist streets - you can feel the eyes of skilled pickpocketers and fraudsters on you.</p><p>The area is also known for the so-called "narcopisos", or drug houses.</p><p>Criminals in the area often attack tourists by throwing them to the ground and using codes such as whistling to identify and track their targets.</p><p>The Old Irish pub is exactly what one would expect- a traditional Irish pub filled with shamrocks and leprechauns for those yearning for a pint of Guinness.</p><p>Levi was last seen leaving the pub around 10pm wearing jeans, a white T-shirt and trainers. He also had his backpack with him.</p><p>It was previously reported that the rugby player watched the Liverpool vs Leeds game on TV as well as a live singer before heading off.</p><p><strong>Did you see Levi?
