He dropped new music sparingly in the years since; his last official single was his track "Nothing," which he dropped in 2014. Last January, Mase hit the stage as part of a Bad Boys tribute to salute Diddy, 51, who received the esteemed Clive Davis Icon award during Davis' iconic pre-Grammy Gala.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Atlanta's Gathering Oasis Church appears to be pleased to welcome the hitmaker onboard, after a peaceful transition of leadership from their former pastor, Cornelius Lindsey. "What more can we say, but 'THANK YOU! For everything you've done for us,'" they wrote to Lindsey on the chapel's official Facebook page.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mase was excited to share the news of his new appointment. He wrote in his announcement post on Instagram Thursday, "THANK YOU üôèüèæ. Also, tag someone who is expecting something great from God and let them know that God has already started answering prayers in 2021. Tag someone looking a new church family and remember, 'ALL PEOPLE ARE WELCOMED' at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>@thegochurch</a>."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Mase and Diddy.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Winter/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In September, Mase made a statement addressing <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kanye West</a>, who seemingly attempted to ridicule him in his 2010 hit song, "Devil in a New Dress." The insult came after Mase first announced his decision to focus on his faith. Mase mentioned that West has also become faith-focused lately (by hosting his own Sunday Services and releasing gospel albums). Betha wrote: "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>#KanyeWest</a>, much of what you are feeling has been expressed before. But when I was saying it, the same system and mindset that you are fighting against today, used you to shame me for leaving the very same system! <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>#Remember</a>, your famous line, 'Don't leave when you hot'? You owe me (and my family) a public <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>#apology</a> and then some, if anyone owes you one. For alluding to the fact that me following God at the height of my career was a bad decision."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Sunday, Atlanta's Gathering Oasis Church former preacher Lindsey gave Mase a heartfelt greeting into his new role. He wrote: Pastor @rsvpmase, first off...WELCOME BACKüòÇü§£! I've been encouraged by our conversations and your heart for the people. You come with a fresh vision and renewed hope. I'm thankful for our initial conversation that started out talking about life and slowly unraveled into a serious conversation on transitioning [leadership of the church] that's brought us to this point today."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Mase.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Gilbert Carrasquillo/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He went on: "I was inspired when we realized that my wife and I started the church the same month and year you transitioned out [of the industry]. And when I started contemplating moving on from pastoring three years ago, you were considering coming back. God was directing our path individually ‚Äî separately ‚Äî until it was time, and the timing was perfect. If all God wanted me to do was remain content in my assignment until you were ready, then I'm fine with that. It was all worth it to get to this point. Nothing was wasted, which is God's style. I'm praying for your continued success! May God bless you on this journey. I love you forever, @thegochurch. ü§üüèæ."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With Mase's exciting news, some fans are hoping he will release a faith-based record soon. "Mase, could a possible gospel album be cooked up in the future? ü§î," one person commented on his Instagram post. Other Instagram users are simply happy to see him continue his religious journey, with one writing, "Bout time bro. Let's get it. Get back to your purpose. Love it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52qwKqvjqaYrJ1do66uscNmp5qrpKS%2FbrvFZpitpJGjwaJ5wqGsq5uYZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shadow-and-bone-cast-in-real-life-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Shadow and Bone' Cast in Real Life: Photos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./vivica-fox-cuban-link-fan-reaction-50-cent-girlfriend-insult-interview.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>I Felt Bad For Her Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
