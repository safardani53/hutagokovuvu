He is a member of the Hart wrestling family and a second-generation wrestler with an amateur wrestling background. He started wrestling while he was a student at&nbsp;Ernest Manning High School and then continued with the sport through college at&nbsp;Mount Royal College. Bret made his in-ring debut in 1978 and since gained championship success throughout the 1980s and 1990s in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). However, in 1997 he left the WWF for World Championship Wrestling (WCW), which is where he remained until October 2000 when he retired. Bret couldn’t stay out of the ring long though because starting in 2004 he began returning for sporadic competitions. In 2010, with WWE, he won his final championship, headlined that year’s SummerSlam event, and served as the general manager of Raw.&nbsp;Throughout his career, Bret headlined WrestleManias IX, X, and XII, and participated in the main event of the 1997 and 1999 editions of WCW&nbsp;Starrcade. In five decades from the 1970s to the 2010s, Bret has held championships, for a total of 32 held throughout his career.&nbsp;He is a seven-time world champion, having held the WWF World Heavyweight Championship five times and the WCW World Heavyweight Championship twice. He spent more time as WWF World Heavyweight Champion than any other wrestler during the 1990s and he was also the first man to win both the WWF and WCW Triple Crown Championships. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2006.&nbsp;Bret&nbsp;revolutionized the industry in the early 1990s by bringing high quality, athletic in-ring performance to the fore, and has cultivated a legacy as one of the greatest wrestlers of all time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>Bret Hart&nbsp;is best known for revolutionizing the wrestling industry as well as being one of the greatest wrestlers who has ever lived.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span class=celeb_profile_label>Personal Life:</span><br>Bret Hart married <strong>Julie Smadu</strong> in 1982 and together the two had four children:&nbsp;<strong>Jade Michelle Hart</strong> (born March 31, 1983); <strong>Dallas Jeffery Hart</strong> (born August 11, 1984); <strong>Alexandra Sabina Hart</strong> (born May 17, 1988); and <strong>Blade Colton Hart</strong> (born June 5, 1990).&nbsp;The four hearts located on the right thigh of his tights symbolize his children, as do the four dots following his signature. However, in 1998 Julie and Bret separated and they eventually divorced in 2002 just hours after Bret had a stroke from hitting his head in a bicycle accident. In 2004 Bret married <strong>Cinzia Rota</strong> but they divorced in 2007 after they couldn’t agree on where to live. His current wife, <strong>Stephanie Washington</strong>, married Bret in 2010. On Feb. 1, 2016, Bret announced that he has prostate cancer via social media.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGianqSVl3yjvsStZKGZoql8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mimi-alford.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Mimi Alford net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./angela-beyince-19821025-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Angela Beyince (Auteur compositeur) - ge, anniversaire, biographie, faits, famille, valeur nette,</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
