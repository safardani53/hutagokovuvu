'Ole's at the wheel' during a stunning pre-season friendly on Saturday.</p><p>The Hoops scored three goals in six second half minutes to <a href=#>thump the Red Devils 4-2 at Loftus Road</a>.</p><img

href=#>QPR</a> fans in the stadium were in such a jubilant mood that they began taunting <a href=#>Man Utd</a> with the famous football tunes.</p><p>They first began with jovially asking them whether they could play them every week.</p><p>And the QPR supporters then went on to mock United manager <a href=#>Solskjaer</a>, who had to witness his side's dreadful afternoon.</p><p>Competitively, the West London side have not beaten United in 17 matches, a run which stretches all the way back to 1992.</p><p>And while this was only a friendly, it was still a game to saviour for their loyal supporters who came out to watch their pre-season warm-up.</p><p>Man Utd got off to the perfect possible start when the returning <a href=#>Jesse Lingard</a> neatly tucked away the opener after less than three minutes.</p><p>But just four minutes later Charlie Austin headed home an equaliser for the home side as the two teams went in all square at half-time.</p><p>QPR took a shock lead in the 53rd minute when Scotland international Lyndon Dykes netted in what would be a crazy few minutes for the hosts.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>COMPETITION: <a href=# rel="noreferrer

Warburton's side just five minutes to extend their advantage as Moses Odubajo made it 3-1 with a screamer from the edge of the area.</p><p>And it was four less than 60 seconds later as Dykes helped himself to his second of the game.</p><p>Anthony Elanga pulled one back for Solskjaer's men 17 minutes from time but it was merely a consolation as QPR eased to a sensational win over the <a href=#>Premier League</a> giants.</p><p>Man Utd's defeat comes on the same day as the <a href=#>announcement that manager Solskjaer has signed a new three-year deal</a> to keep him contracted at the club until 2024.</p><p>After putting pen to paper, the Norwegian said: “Everyone knows the feeling I have for this club, and I am delighted to have signed this new contract.</p><p>"It is an exciting time for Manchester United, we have built a squad with a good balance of youth and experienced players that are hungry for success.</p><p>“I have a fantastic coaching team around me, and we are all ready to take that next step on our journey.</p><p>"Manchester United wants to be winning the biggest and best trophies and that’s what we are all striving for.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title
