However, the former Suits star has plenty of friends to lean on when the going gets rough.</p><p>More than a year after she tied the knot with the prince, the California native admitted that some of her closest pals had warned her about sparking a romance with such a public figure.</p><p>“It’s hard,” she told ITV News at Ten anchor <strong>Tom Bradby</strong> for the documentary <a href=#>Harry & Meghan: An African Journey</a>, which aired in October 2019. “I don’t think anybody could understand that. … But when I first met my now-husband, my friends were really happy because I was so happy but my British friends said to me, ‘I’m sure he’s great, but you shouldn’t do it because the British tabloids will destroy your life.'”</p><p>In the same interview, Meghan admitted that she <a href=#>had “no idea” that things would get so complicated</a> when she first fell in love with Harry. While she didn’t think it would be “easy” to date a member of the royal family, the retired actress still hoped that she would receive “fair” treatment from the press.</p><p>Following a number of ups and downs, Meghan and her husband <a href=#>announced in January 2020</a> that they would be stepping down from their senior roles in the royal family. Two months later, they <a href=#>made their official exit</a> and moved to California after a brief stay in Vancouver, Canada.</p><p>Despite taking time away from the royal spotlight, Meghan’s personal life hasn’t been free from drama. In June 2020, a source told Us Weekly exclusively that she was “done” with former BFF <a href=#><strong>Jessica Mulroney</strong></a>, who had been a close confidant even before her days in the royal family. After Mulroney <a href=#>got caught up in a scandal</a> with influencer <strong>Sasha Exeter</strong>, Meghan made it clear that she was <a href=#>trying to “distance herself”</a> from her old pal.</p><p>“Of course Meghan is supportive of Jessica, as she is with all of her friends, but it’s a bit off-putting when Jessica seemingly uses their friendship for headlines,” the source said at the time.</p><p>In February 2021, Meghan and Harry announced that they were <a href=#>expecting their second child</a> together just days before Buckingham Palace confirmed that the pair were no longer working members of the royal family. One month later, the Tig founder got <a href=#>caught up in a major controversy</a> as former staffers came forward with allegations of mistreatment at Meghan’s hands. While her team denied the reports, a statement from the palace revealed that an <a href=#>investigation into the bullying claims</a> would be taking place.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s OBSCENE that the Royal Family, who’s [sic] newest member is currently GROWING INSIDE OF HER, is promoting and amplifying accusations of ‘bullying’ against a woman who herself was basically forced to [flee] the UK in order protect her family and her own mental health,” Suits alum <a href=#><strong>Patrick J. Adams</strong></a> wrote in a <a href=#>scathing Twitter thread</a> in March 2021, calling out the “seemingly archaic and toxic” environment within the palace. “Find someone else to admonish, berate and torment. My friend Meghan is way out of your league.”</p><p>Scroll down to learn more about Meghan’s closest friendships!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuqazx5qlZqWRp7itsdJmmqWno5rAtXnFq6CeppSofA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rhiannon-fish-5-things-about-hallmarks-my-norwegian-holiday-star.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rhiannon Fish: 5 Things About Hallmark's My Norwegian Holiday Star</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jack-meloche-20060515-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jack Meloche (Family Member) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
