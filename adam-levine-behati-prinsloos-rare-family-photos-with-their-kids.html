The Maroon 5 frontman shares two children with wife <a href=#><strong>Behati Prinsloo</strong></a>, and the couple have been selective about sharing photos of the little ones over the years.</p><p>The pair, who <a href=#>wed in July 2014 in Mexico</a>, became parents in September 2016 when <a href=#>daughter Dusty arrived</a>. Nearly two years later, the toddler became a big sister when the model<a href=#> gave birth to daughter Gio</a>. In January 2023, it was reported that they became a family of five.</p><p>The former Victoria’s Secret Angel was on the fence about adding a third baby to her and the musician’s family, she told Entertainment Tonight in November 2021.</p><p>“We always knew we wanted a second one,” the Namibia native told the outlet at the time. “So I think for me … when I had two babies under the age of 2, I was just like, ‘Don’t even think about it!<a href=#>‘ I do also want five kids</a>. But don’t even think about it. Never say never. We want a big family. Who knows? We’re leaving it up to fate and just what happens. What will happen, will happen. So there are no limits to it.”</p><p>The Calirosa creator repeated that she would “never say never” to baby No. 3, adding, “I think it’s just kind of where we are in our life. And with [the] COVID [pandemic] too, I was just seeing [my daughters] together, like, ‘Maybe we should have a third just to have more kids.’ Because it was so sweet to see [them together]. But then, I don’t know.”</p><p>Levine, for his part, previously told <a href=#><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a> in July 2018 that <a href=#>his wife wants to have “100 babies”</a> with him. “I don’t know if I can do that,” the Grammy winner joked during <a href=#>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a> appearance at the time. “I want a lot. I thrive in chaos.”</p><p>The couple sparked rumors in March 2020 tha<a href=#>t Prinsloo was pregnant with baby No. 3</a> when she posted a blurry ultrasound photo via Instagram that many of her followers believed to be an ultrasound.</p><p>“Dusty got hold of my phone and somehow posted this picture from my photo library,” Prinsloo subsequently clarified in the social media upload’s caption. “I thought it was weird and cool and left it up. But everyone is now congratulating me on my 3rd pregnancy. It’s a close up of my black and white splatter sweat pants!”</p><p>The following month, Levine told <a href=#><strong>Howard Stern</strong> </a>that his partner would “punch [him] in the f–king face” if he asked her to<a href=#> have another so soon</a> after Gio’s February 2018 arrival.</p><p>Prinsloo announced that <a href=#>she was pregnant with the couple’s third child</a> in September 2022. That same month, Instagram model <a href=#><strong>Sumner Stroh</strong> accused Levine of cheating on his wife with her.</a></p><p>The musician denied the infidelity accusations, writing via Instagram at the time, “I used poor judgment in speaking with anyone other than my wife in ANY kind of flirtatious manner. I did not have an affair, nevertheless, I crossed the line during a regrettable period of my life. In certain instances it became inappropriate. I have addressed that and taken proactive steps to remedy this with my family.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The social media post concluded: “My wife and my family is all I care about in this world. To be this naive and stupid enough to risk the only thing that truly matters to me was the greatest mistake I could ever make. I will never make it again. I take full responsibility. We will get through it and we will get through it together.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see the “Payphone” singer and Prinsloo’s sweetest moments with their kids:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkrqWtzGajnq6Zo7JursShmK2hXaW%2FqrrSpaaoq12nrrOxjJ%2BYpqGcrnqxtM6tpqxlp57BqXnToZyiql2gtqW%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./silentc0re.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Silentc0re- Net Worth, Bio, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Ethnicity, Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-malu-trevejo-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Malu Trevejo Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
