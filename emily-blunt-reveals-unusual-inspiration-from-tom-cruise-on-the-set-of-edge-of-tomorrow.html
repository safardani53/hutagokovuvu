She told presenters Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes, and Will Arnett that Cruise told her to “stop being a pu**y” when she couldn’t work in a hefty outfit.</p><p>“He just stood there staring at me, not knowing what to do, and then he says, ‘Come on, stop being such a p—y, OK?'”</p><p></p><p>Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise portray warriors trapped in a time loop who must defend the Earth and the human population from invaders in Edge of Tomorrow. They had to wear hefty costumes while executing difficult action scenes in the sci-fi picture.&nbsp;While Tom Cruise is famed for doing his own stunts, Emily Blunt was fresh to the experience.</p><h2>Emily Blunt required a male stunt double. Because of the bulk of her outfit</h2><p>According to The Times, Emily Blunt stated that she became upset on set during shooting Edge of Tomorrow due to the heavy clothes.</p><p>“We had to wear these massive outfits, which I believe would have been wonderful if CGI’d, but we wanted to do it in a tactile manner.” When you hear the term tactile, you think of something lovely and cozy; these outfits were everything but. It weighed about 85 pounds. “The first time I put it on, I began crying, and [Tom] had no idea what to do.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Emily-Blunt.jpg alt="Emily Blunt" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She said that Tom Cruise was gazing at her as she began crying due to the heavy clothing.</p><p>“He simply looked at me and said, ‘I know, I know,'” ‘Tom, I’m not sure how I’m going to get through this shoot,’ I said, sobbing. “I told her, ‘I’m feeling a little nervous about the entire shoot.'”</p><p>The Mission Impossible actor then begged Blunt to get herself together, which eventually helped her with the filming. The Mary Poppins actor also said that male stunt doubles were used instead of girls since the outfits were too heavy to handle.&nbsp;Emily Blunt was even injured during filming Edge of Tomorrow because the costume bruised her collarbone and ribs and is still “dodgy” eight years later.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Emily-Blunt-2.jpg alt="Emily Blunt" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Blunt said in a 2018 interview with IndieWire that Tom Cruise requested her to appear in the sequel to Edge of Tomorrow. The actress claimed that the crew approached her about appearing in the sequel, but she was too busy filming Mary Poppins at the time.&nbsp;She did, however, say that if the stars ever aligned and all of them were available at the same time, she would be on board with the concept.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGicpqGcrnqjuNSnq2aqlauyorjSZqynraOqrq15yKeqqaGilsGqu81mnaunnWLBsLmMnKmuoaOaerC6jK2fnmWjmsFuu8VmnJ2flWK8p3nTqKSoqqKkxHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ashley-etienne.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Ashley Etienne net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./donna-pescow.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Donna Pescow</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
