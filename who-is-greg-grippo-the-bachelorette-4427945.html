Victoria is on the current season of&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bachelor in Paradise</a>, which filmed during summer 2022. On the show, she’s in a pretty serious relationship with&nbsp;<strong>Johnny DePhillipo</strong>, and all signs point to them possibly getting engaged during the Nov. 22 finale.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>However, in real time, Victoria’s been spending time with Greg. After fans spotted them on vacation in Italy together,&nbsp;<strong>Nick Viall</strong> posted a TikTok video that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>showed her kissing him</a> on the cheek.&nbsp;<strong>Jesse Palmer</strong> has promised that all will be answered during the&nbsp;BIP finale. Until then, learn more about Greg here.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/the-bachelorette-katie-hometowns-embed1.jpg><h2>1. What Happened To Greg On ‘The Bachelorette’?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Greg was on season 17 of&nbsp;The Bachelorette&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Katie Thurston</strong></a>. They connected from the very first night when Katie gave Greg her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first impression rose</a>. After that, he also got the very first one-on-one of the season. In fact, Greg was the only guy to get two one-on-one dates before hometowns, and he then made it to Katie’s final three after she met his family.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Things fell apart for Katie and Greg before their fantasy suite date, though. They had an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>explosive fight</a>, which began because Greg didn’t like how Katie reacted when he expressed how much he loved her. He said he felt treated like just another “number”, like the other men, instead of Katie’s potential fiance. Greg left the show after the pair’s tumultuous breakup.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>At&nbsp;After The Final Rose, they proved they still <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>weren’t on good terms</a>. Katie accused Greg of never wanting to get engaged to begin with, and claimed that he was using his time on the show as acting practice.</p><h2>2. What Does Greg Do For A Living?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Greg’s&nbsp;Bachelorette bio confirmed that he was a Marketing Sales Representative from Edison, New Jersey. He currently works as an account manager at Mondo, according to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn</a>. Mondo is a staffing agency that specializes in “high end, niche IT, tech and digital marketing talent.” Greg has worked there since Nov. 2020. Before that, he was a Marketing Executive at a wellness company called Melaleuca.</p><h2>3. Where Did Greg Go To College?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/greg-grippo-5-things-to-know-abc-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Greg attended Saint Michael’s College in Colchester Vermont. He graduated in 2016 with a Bachelor’s of Business Administration in Marketing. After college, Greg appears to have moved to New York City, as that’s where his subsequent jobs were located.</p><h2>4. Greg Played Basketball</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/the-bachelorette-katie-hometowns-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Greg played for his college basketball team at Saint Michael’s. Even as a freshman, he played in all of the team’s games. Greg was named captain of the team during his senior year, as well. He comes from an athletic family, as his brother played football at Kean University and his sister played basketball at Rutgers-Newark.</p><h2>5. How Old Is Greg?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Greg was 27 years old when he filmed&nbsp;The Bachelorette in the spring of 2021. However, he revealed on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> that he celebrated his 28th birthday on the weekend of June 5 that year. He shared a series of photos from the celebrations, writing, “Bringing in 28 with my people.” So, as of Nov. 2022, he is 29 years old.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K0s7HGZp6roaClvG7Ax55km5mTnbKtu9Geq62dXWmBc4OYbWxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./boys-in-blue.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Boys in Blue - Showtime</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-dolan-twins-tease-so-much-to-come-in-2020-for-fans-reveal-theyve-grown-in-a-number-of-ways.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Dolan Twins Talk YouTube Break &amp;amp; New Fragrance Company Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
