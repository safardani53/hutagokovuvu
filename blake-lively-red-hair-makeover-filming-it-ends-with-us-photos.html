As seen below, the 35-year-old actress switched out her signature honey-blonde tresses for reddish-brown locks as she plays her character, Lily Bloom. The below photo was taken on Monday, May 15 in New York City. Just a few weeks ago, Blake rocked her usual hair color at t<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he grand re-opening of Tiffany’s New York City store</a>, which can also be seen below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blake-Lively-Red-Hair-Makeover-SS-embed-11.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Blake appears to be wearing a wig for her part, as just three days before she was photographed filming the movie, she was seen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>attending<strong> Taylor Swift</strong>‘s Eras Tour</a> with her oldest two children with&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>James</strong>, 7, and&nbsp;<strong>Inez</strong>, 6</a>. After the concert ended, some lucky fans saw Taylor, 33, exiting the stage with Blake, James, and Inez, and Blake appeared to have blonde hair. Footage of them leaving the backstage area can be viewed <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blake-Lively-Red-Hair-Makeover-SS-embed-31.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>The<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Gossip Girl </a>alum was also filming with her co-star,<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Justin Baldoni</strong></a>, on Monday, who was cast as Ryle Kincaid, Lily’s love interest. In addition to co-starring in the film, Blake is serving as an executive producer, while Justin is directing. Now that’s one talented duo! Blake was photographed wearing a brown fit and flare dress, while Justin donned an all-black ensemble and sat on a stoop behind her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blake-Lively-Red-Hair-Makeover-SS-embed-21.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Although Blake is a generally beloved star, there was some criticism over the casting director’s decision to include her in the movie because of her age. Lily was written as a 23-year-old character, and Blake is 12 years above that as of this writing. “There comes a point when actors and actresses must be real with themselves.. because why is old a** Blake Lively playing Lily? I would have loved to see a fresh face,” one critic <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a> in January after Blake and Justin’s casting was announced. “I love Blake Lively, but in my personal opinion, she is too old to play Lily in It Ends With Us,” another <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote</a>, with dozens more in agreement.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>It Ends With Us is based on the novel written by <strong>Colleen Hoover</strong> of the same name. It follows the relationship that forms between Lily and Ryle, a neurosurgeon, and how they navigate their attraction as they face skeletons from their past. A release date for the film has yet to be announced.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH12e5BuZpukkaCybrjIr5ylsV2nsqV5x5qgq2Wdlrimu9WeqWaemaG6qrrGZqCtZZWjsbR51qKroWWlqHqxtM6tpqxn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./khloe-kardashian-horrifies-fans-with-donut-lips.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Khloe Kardashian Horrifies Fans with &amp;quot;Donut Lips&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-pearlescentmoon-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is PearlescentMoon Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
