joined by Lola, 22, and Michael, 26, to bake holiday cookies for a fun segment on their talk show.</p><p>The married hosts, who also share 20-year-old son <a href=#>Joaquin</a>, watched on as their kids tried their hand at making gingerbread cookies.</p><p>As the 20-somethings took turns reading the recipe off the teleprompter and telling their parents what steps to take next, the hosts also asked their kids a few questions.</p><p>At one point, Kelly asked: “Hey guys, how do you think Dad’s doing as a host of the show?”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Live">Read More on Live</h2><p>Mark smiled as he rolled out the cookie dough, waiting to hear their responses.</p><p>Unfortunately, <a href=#>Lola</a> completely disregarded the question and abruptly returned to sharing more of the cookie recipe.</p><p><a href=#>Michael</a>, meanwhile, said that he thinks his dad is “killing it” as the new Live co-host.</p><p>Everyone seemed to be focused more on Lola’s apparent shade toward her dad, though, as the crowd erupted in shocked laughter.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Mark, too, appeared stunned as he looked up from his rolling pin toward the audience after the awkward moment.</p><p>Live with Kelly and Mark’s official Instagram shared a clip of the moment and added a teardrop falling from the new co-host’s eye to further show his surprise at his daughter’s shade.</p><p>One fan, who seemed to have trouble hearing Michael’s response, commented: “My favorite was when Kelly asked them how Dad was doing on the show and they both didn’t answer.”</p><p>After making a guest appearance on Tuesday’s show, Lola and Michael returned for some <a href=#>more on-air fun on Friday</a>.</p><p>The duo sat at a large table on set alongside their parents, as well as some of the other show members and their own families.</p><p>With the year almost over, everyone took turns looking back on their favorite memories from the show.</p><p>Though everyone enjoyed being mostly all together for the event, Kelly said she was a little sad to not have all of her kids there.</p><p>The host said: "It's so nice to have everyone here for our holiday feast. We're just missing Joaquin. I wish he was here."</p><p>Kelly went on to explain that her and Mark's 20-year-old son is still at the University of&nbsp;<a href=#>Michigan</a>, where he attends college.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/kelly-ripa-mark-consuelos-daughter-868001104.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/kelly-ripa-michael-consuelos-lola-786292333-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxaWh%2Bc36XaKKepJyuerO1z5pkppmioHqku82srJ6kn6h6rbvLmmSsoJGZsm66xLBkoaejqXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rachel-hollis-to-fellow-stretch-marked-moms-you-inspire-me.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rachel Hollis to Fellow Stretch-Marked Moms: You Inspire Me!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hazel-renee-ethnicity-what-is-draymond-green-wife-background.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hazel Renee Ethnicity: What Is Draymond Green Wife Background?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
