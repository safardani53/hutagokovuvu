Teeter was ordered to leave the bunkhouse in Season 4, Episode 6. Meanwhile, Jen landed a new role on FBI: Most Wanted in January 2021, and she doesn't seem to be credited on the new Yellowstone episodes.

What does this mean?</h2><p>Sweeping changes might be underway for the women working on the Dutton family ranch. The barrel racer girls, including flirtatious Laramie (Hassie Harrison), got kicked out following the latest altercation between Lloyd Pierce (Forrie J. Smith) and <a href=#>Walker</a> (Ryan Bingham).</p><p>The ranch hands started competing for Laramie's heart in Season 3 of <a href=#>Yellowstone</a>. Laramie stirred up heated conflict by choosing Walker over Lloyd. Now, it seems that every girl will suffer.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Several Yellowstone viewers rushed to Twitter to point out that Teeter got the boot because of her gender — which doesn't send out the most progressive message. Let's not forget that Teeter agreed to get the Duttons' initials burnt into her chest a handful of episodes ago. It seems that the sacrifice didn't mean that much after all.</p><p>"How is Yellowstone going to send Teeter packing like that?! She took the brand ... or did they forget?" tweeted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@mumofshepherds</a>.</p><p>"They better not get rid of Teeter for good. As it is I could never get enough of her. Plus, she took the brand! They owe it to her not to get rid of her. Where [is] their loyalty? Yellowstone, please keep Teeter." tweeted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@Gloria39020259</a>.</p><p>"I feel bad for Teeter. I was kinda hoping she beat up the blonde.

Teeter first laid eyes upon fellow ranch hand Colby (Denim Richards) soon afterward, but they started dating much later.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As loyal Yellowstone fans are bound to recall, Teeter and Colby exchanged their first kiss shortly following enemy rancher Wade Morrow's (Boots Southerland) ruthless attack. The lovebirds went skinny-dipping in Season 3, Episode 8, only to get trodden on and whipped by Wade and his evil gang. Teeter and Colby recovered from their injuries and took the branding iron a few episodes later.</p><p>Catch new episodes of Yellowstone every Sunday at 8 p.m. EST on Paramount Network.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuwMSeq56qXaGyosLIp55msZWhubDD0q2mp50%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meek-mill-rihanna-diss-track-exes-drake-nicki-minaj-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meek Mill &amp;amp; Rihannas Diss Track Will Slam Exes Drake and Nicki Minaj Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-michael-allio-the-bachelorette-4431790.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Michael Allio?
