So now that season 15 is upon us, and we know Drew’s been going through an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>emotional divorce</a> from her estranged husband, <strong>Ralph</strong> <strong>Pittman</strong>, we wondered how Sanya felt upon hearing the news. Was she gloating over it? Not at all actually. In fact, she was both surprised and “heartbroken”.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“[Drew and I] have some really good conversations this season, and we get to a good place [before the news breaks]. And I’m happy that happened because I was heartbroken when I heard the news about her and Ralph splitting,” Sanya told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY while appearing on this week’s episode of the<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Pay Attention Puh-Lease! podcast</a> and promoting season 15. “[My husband] and I were actually at the birthday party for Ralph that she threw for him like a week before for his 40th, prior to the news breaking. Literally, we had the best time. We were done [filming], it was off camera, and it was a whole lot of fun. So I was like, ‘What the hell?’ They looked perfect like a week [before that]. So yeah, I was really disappointed [upon hearing the news].”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I was very surprised. We all know — we see it on camera — that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>they had some issues</a>,” Sanya continued. However, she said she’s also seen them “laugh together” and “have fun”, so she thought they’d “get past” their troubles. To “see that they are here now is really tough,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sanya-drew-rhoa-season-15-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Drew and Ralph both filed for divorce on Feb. 27 after nearly nine years of marriage. And in an amended divorce filing on March 1, Drew claimed Ralph is a “serial cheater and adulterer”, who abused her mentally, financially and at one point, got “physically aggressive” with her. Season 15 of RHOA had already wrapped filming in January, but <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a> reported on March 5 that Bravo brought cameras out again to capture the fallout of those explosive allegations. We got a glimpse of that in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the season 15 trailer</a>, but we can imagine a lot more will be shown as the season plays out over the next few months.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>And considering the heartache that we know Drew is going through, it’s nice to hear she and Sanya are in a better place with each other. But her relationship with Drew is not all that Sanya talked about during our interview. She also touched upon the show’s explosive season premiere that included a near physical altercation, <strong>Shereé Whitfield</strong>‘s hot new romance, a possible new love interest for <strong>Kenya</strong> <strong>Moore</strong> and more!
