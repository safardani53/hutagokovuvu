I was really unhappy with myself so my darts game wasn't that good," she said.</p><p>"When you're not feeling great then nothing in life will be really, really good. I quit darts and then I became a happier version of myself but then I really wanted to start playing darts again.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Other Sports</h2></p><p>"I tried to enjoy life as much as possible. I transitioned before going through a lot of meetings with a psychologist."</p><p>If taking on Greaves was her hardest battle in the sporting arena, nothing compared to telling her family and friends of what she was going through.</p><p>"It was really tough," explained Van Leuven.</p><p>"I told a really good friend of mine and she was really supportive but she also said I had to tell my mum.</p><p>"I think it was about a week later when I told her and a week later I was already at the doctors and I think it took me a couple more months before I told my dad and other family members, but they were all really supportive to me.</p><p>"It was really nice which has really helped me through everything."</p><p>In the meantime, Van Leuven worked as a mediator offering support for trans people.</p><p>However, she was left heartbroken when their families revealed some had lost their lives to <a href=#>suicide.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/noa-lynn-van-leuven-834195799-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/noa-lynn-van-leuven-834195847.jpg><p>"There were a few people that I talked to a lot and then suddenly you don't hear from them anymore and then you have to hear from the parents that they're not there any more. It is devastating," an emotional Van Leuven told <a href=#>Sky Sports</a>.</p><p>"They're all waiting on trans-health care and I think there's a waiting list of up to three years in the Netherlands before you get your first appointment, so that's really tough on some people.</p><p>"It is way too long to wait because a lot of people in that position are depressed, they're really unhappy with themselves. They're not getting the help they need, so it is way too long."</p><p>The Darts Regulation Authority, the governing body for the PDC, states: "Darts is open to all who wish to be involved in any capacity and we encourage all trans and non-binary participants to take part."</p><p>That has allowed Van Leuven to compete in the sport she has fallen in love with. She is also sympathetic for other sports that exclude trans athletes from competing in the categories they want to assign themselves with.</p><p>She revealed: "I feel devastated by the people that get hit by that.</p><p>"I think it's tough for transgender people to play sports, especially when people know that you're trans because you have a big advantage until you prove it's not."</p><p>Her fellow female pros Greaves and <a href=#>Fallon Sherrock</a> have praised Van Leuven for doing her part in raising trans awareness in darts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/167dca79-583e-4978-bc5d-cbe385af3d88.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/noa-lynn-van-leuven-834195848.jpg><p>Although, she hasn't always felt welcome. She admitted when she won the Denmark Open she felt uncomfortable in front of the other players, who were talking about her behind her back.</p><p>"After I won there was the presentation on stage and I just had a weird feeling about something that happened on stage. The other players were talking to each other and I felt it was about me," Van Leuven explained.</p><p>"I was right because someone told me but I just don't think it was the right place or time to do something like that.</p><p>"They were complaining about me, so they had to [come] forward against me and do it altogether [to throw me out of the competition] which kind of ruined the moment.</p><p>"I worked hard for that title. I played really good games throughout the day and in the end I won. People who had match darts against me didn't take their opportunities but I took mine.
