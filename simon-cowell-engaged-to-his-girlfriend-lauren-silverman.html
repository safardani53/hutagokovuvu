They’ve been together for 13 years. Eric, Simon and Lauren’s son, was born in 2014.</p><h2>Simon proposed to Lauren in what way?</h2><p>Simon Cowell, the judge on America’s Got Talent, met his soulmate, Lauren Silverman, for the first time at a resort on the Caribbean island of Barbados. In 2008, they began dating. The pair went on a family holiday to Barbados for Christmas and New Year’s when he intended to surprise her. And on Christmas Eve 2021, he proposed to his now-fiancee on the beach in Barbados, where they initially met.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/simon-cowell-and-lauren-silverman-2.jpg><p>According to their close pals,</p><p>“They’re both overjoyed. They’ve been together for a long time and like one other, so their close pals aren’t surprised.”</p><p>Cowell and Silverman announced their pregnancy in July 2013, and their son Eric was born in February 2014.&nbsp;We wish the pair the best of luck with their wedding plans!</p><h2>Simon was introduced to Lauren by her ex.</h2><p>Ladies man Simon was introduced to then-married New York socialite Lauren Silverman in Barbados in 2006 by none other than Lauren’s then-husband Andrew Silverman. Andrew is a real estate billionaire and a buddy of Simon’s. After the encounter, Andrew, Lauren, and Simon would often go on vacation together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/simon-cowell-and-lauren-silverman-1.jpg><p>Lauren and Andrew have a 16-year-old son named Adam.&nbsp;Later, there were rumors that Simon and Lauren were having an affair. Andrew filed for divorce from Lauren in July 2013, alleging infidelity as the cause for the split. When questioned about it, Simon said,</p><p>“There are a lot of things I’ll finally clear up when the time comes, but I have to be very careful since there are a lot of people’s sentiments at stake here.”</p><h2>Timeline of Simon Cowell’s relationships</h2><p>In 2002, the X-Factor judge dated English entertainment reporter and actress Terri Seymour. They divorced in 2006.&nbsp;Following that, he became engaged to Mezhgan Hussainy, an Afghani cosmetics artist.&nbsp;He proposed to her with a rectangular 6-carat diamond set in platinum worth £250,000.&nbsp;From 2010 until 2011, they were together. However, he believes that his connection with Mezhgan was his worst mistake. He also refers to himself as a hopeless boyfriend. He and Mezhgan had heated arguments.</p><p>Simon revealed,</p><p>“Mezhgan’s behavior makes my stomach churn.”</p><p>After his separation from Afghani makeup artist, he moved out of their home in Holland Park, West London, and into a hotel. After the breakup, he blames himself and says,</p><p>“We decided that I’m a hopeless lover – and I don’t blame her.”</p><p>Adding,</p><p>“I had to be careful about her stance since I didn’t want to offend her family, with whom I had become extremely close.”</p><h2>Simon Cowell’s Bio in Brief</h2><p>Simon Cowell is a reality television judge and producer from England, as well as an entrepreneur and philanthropist.
