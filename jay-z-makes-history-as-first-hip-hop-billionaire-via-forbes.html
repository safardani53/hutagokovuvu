Or if you want to start some sort of barbershop or car wash — those were the businesses back then. Things you can get in easily to get out of [that] life.”</p><p>Jay-Z (née Shawn Carter) told VF that he knew his former profession wasn’t something he could maintain, however: “At some point, you have to have an exit strategy, because your window is very small; you’re going to get locked up or you’re going to die.”</p><p>Jay-Z also recalled watching his mom, Gloria Carter, struggle to make ends meet while growing up. “We were living in a tough situation, but my mother managed; she juggled,” he told the publication. “ Sometimes we’d pay the light bill, sometimes we paid the phone, sometimes the gas went off.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Still, he says Gloria made it work. “We weren’t starving — we were eating, we were OK.”</p><p>Despite how far he’s come financially, it’s not all about the dollar bills for the “Young Forever” crooner: Jay-Z spoke about the <a href=#>correlation between money and happiness</a> in a 2011 interview. “They’re not tied to each other. [Money] allows you freedom, it allows you to go places where you can smile and you look at the sunset, but there a lot of people with tons of money who aren’t happy,” he pointed out. “Life is about balance, right, you have to have some type of balance. There’s time for work and time for play.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGasV2veq6typ6qZqCZqMGwvthmmKxllp6%2FtMCMoaCpZZikvW6uyKWjoqeelrazsYyvoJpllqS%2Fo7HSaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./justaminx-real-name-family-sister.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>JustAMinx Gets Into Massive Family Drama With Her Sister</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hailee-steinfeld-fitness-diet-secrets-from-trainer-dad.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hailee Steinfeld Fitness, Diet Secrets From Trainer Dad</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
