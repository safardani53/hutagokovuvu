according to local news outlet <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWAY3</a>.</p><p>It's unclear what drove Fox & Hound out of the spot but Mayfaire was disappointed to learn that the popular restaurant has left.</p><p>"Our top priority is to provide a vibrant shopping and dining environment and are committed to bringing in fresh and innovative options," a
