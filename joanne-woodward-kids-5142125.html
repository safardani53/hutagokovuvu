Aside from her work in movies like Rachel, Rachel, and others, Joanne was famous for her long-lasting marriage to the late actor&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Paul Newman</strong></a>. The pair got married in 1958 and maintained their strong bond until his death in 2008. Together, Paul and his wife welcomed three out of his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>six children</a>. Aside from his kids with Joanne, Paul was a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>proud dad</a> to&nbsp;<strong>Scott Newman</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Stephanie Newman</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Susan Kendall Newman</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Unfortunately, Joanne has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>been battling Alzheimer’s</a> since 2007. The documentary&nbsp;The Last Movie Stars&nbsp;revealed that the actress lived with her family in Connecticut. A source gave an update on her in a report from&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>OK! Magazine&nbsp;</a>in April 2023. “At this point, the best that can be done for Joanne is to keep her comfortable while waiting for the inevitable. It’s a tribute to her courage and determination she has lived with this debilitating disease as long as she has,” they said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Joanne’s daughter, <strong>Melissa, </strong>compiled a book about her parents’ love story Head Over Heels: Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman: A Love Affair in Words and Pictures&nbsp;in October 2023. Their relationship also served as the basis for the 2023 HBO film&nbsp;The Last Movie Stars.&nbsp;Keep reading to find out about his three daughters with the now 93-year-old!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nell-newman-ss-embed.jpg><h2>Nell Newman</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>One year after Paul and the&nbsp;A Big Hand for the Little Lady&nbsp;star got married, they welcomed their first daughter,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nell Newman </strong></a>(b. 1959). Their eldest child appeared in a few movies in her younger years but ultimately went on to focus on “charitable giving,” per the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Nell Newman Foundation</a> website. A few of the movies that she was featured in include&nbsp;The Effect of Gamma Rays&nbsp;(1972),&nbsp;Rachel, Rachel&nbsp;(1968), and&nbsp;Fed Up!&nbsp;(2002). She notably co-starred in the first two movies listed alongside her famous momma.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Nell often shares photos of both of her parents via Instagram to reminisce on the fond memories she has of them. Most recently, on Jan. 27, 2023, the 64-year-old took to Instagram to share a cute <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>throwback photo</a> with her dad during her younger years. “Today I miss my Pop more than usual. This picture was from the good old days when Pop raced for <strong>Bob Sharp</strong> Datsun. The pits were best navigated on a mini bike,” she captioned the photo with the&nbsp;Cool Hand Luke&nbsp;star. She married&nbsp;<strong>Gary Irving</strong> in 2005, together they have no children.</p><h2>Melissa Newman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/melissa-newman-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Two years after Nell was born, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Joanne and Paul</a> welcomed their second daughter,&nbsp;Melissa Newman (b. 1961). The now 61-year-old starred in a few movies growing up, but ultimately opted to pursue a career out of the entertainment industry. Some of her movies include&nbsp;Mr. and Mrs. Bridge&nbsp;(1990),&nbsp;The Undefeated&nbsp;(1969), and&nbsp;Sometimes a Great Notion&nbsp;(1971). Her father and mother notably starred in a few of those same films as well.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>In recent years, Melissa appeared on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>BBC’s Breakfast</a> talk show in Oct. 2022 to chat about her father’s posthumous memoir, The Extraordinary Life of an Ordinary Man. “I was thinking about this in being asked to be an authority on my parents… and I thought well who is an authority on their parents?”, she said at the time. “They were my parents. I’m an authority on being their child.” She even admitted that there are many films that both of her parents starred in that she still has not seen. As mentioned above, she also compiled the book&nbsp;Head Over Heels&nbsp;about her parents’ love story.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Melissa is married to&nbsp;<strong>Raphael Elkind </strong>and they have two kids:&nbsp;<strong>Henry Elkind </strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Peter Elkind</strong>.</p><h2>Claire “Clea” Olivia Newman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/claire-newman-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>In 1965, Paul and his wife expanded their family for the final time when they welcomed their daughter,&nbsp;<strong>Claire “Clea” Olivia Newman</strong>. Claire is the closest to following in her parents footsteps out of her two older sisters. The now 58-year-old is a TV producer and has worked on many hit TV shows including&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Big Little Lies</a>,&nbsp;The Big C,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;Love & Death</a>, and more, per her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb profile</a>. Although she has not starred in these projects, she is credited for working on the editorial department and as the producer for the Max series.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>In 2017, she spoke to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Daily Mail</a>&nbsp;about her late father in admiration. “Dad was like a big kid,” she said at the time. “He was like a kid in the way that nothing stopped him. You know how children feel they can do anything? My dad was like that. Not in an egotistical way, but he thought, ‘Why should there be barriers?'” Clea is married to&nbsp;<strong>Kurt Soderlund&nbsp;</strong>and does not appear to have any children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8momKemlWLEsLvDsJirnF2gtqW%2FjG5obWphZ4Jw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amanda-diaz.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Amanda Diaz</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-hannah-loyd-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Hannah Loyd Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
