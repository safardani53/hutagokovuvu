So was it all a dream?&nbsp;We’ll get to that later.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Victoria wakes up to the sound of creaky floorboards. Thinking someone has broken into the beach house — someone has, and it’s Emily — &nbsp;she runs downstairs. Unfortunately, Emily is too damn stealthy and hides behind the stairwell.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Emily returns home to Nolan, who may or may not be sleeping in the Grayson Manor pool house, and gives him a knife she found in David’s house. She thinks it might be the murder weapon that killed Conrad.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Meanwhile, after finding out Emily’s true identity, Danilel (<strong>Joshua Bowman</strong>) takes a walk down memory lane and looks through their wedding photos. He then heads to the beach house to confront Victoria, telling her that her plan to paint Emily in bad light is going to come back and bite her in the ass. She, however, sees things differently. (As always.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>In a bid to get to know his (supposed) dead daughter better, David sets out on a mission to talk with&nbsp;some of Amanda’s friends. He starts with a visit to Jack (<strong>Nick Wechsler</strong>), who suggests he meet up with Emily.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Emily and David’s first interaction with each other, post-flight 197, doesn’t go so well. Emily gets fired up about Victoria and tells David about the time she pushed a very pregnant Amanda off the balcony.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>He doesn’t seem to happy about it, but even worse, Emily is distraught by the fact that David lies to her about where he was all this time and&nbsp;doesn’t even recognize that she’s the real Amanda.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“Who the hell is he, Nolan?” Emily asks, following her emotional reunion with daddy dearest.</p><h3>Louise Tries To Kill Margaux&nbsp;& Daniel Seeks Out Emily</h3><p id=content-paragraph-11>Later, Louise hits the sauna with Margaux&nbsp;after an intense round of tennis. But the former psychiatric home inhabitant&nbsp;cuts their time short when she gets jealous about Margaux’s&nbsp;relationship with Daniel. And in a strange turn of events, Louise’s (dead?) mother convinces her to kill Margaux&nbsp;by locking her in the steam room and cranking the temperature way up!</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Margaux&nbsp;somehow rips the metal bar off the door and smashes the glass before she collapses into the outside room full of fresh air. (Am I the only one who hoped she’d meet her maker? #Sorrynotsorry.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>While Margaux&nbsp;was fighting for her life, her boyfriend was busy chasing Emily. Daniel confronts Emily — or can we finally say Amanda? — in an elevator of an office building and bribes her a bit. As long as she doesn’t take him down, when her game of charades with David and Victoria goes to hell, he’ll keep her secret. She agrees.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>But what’s most interesting is that Daniel&nbsp;still seems to have some lingering feelings for his ex-wife. While in the elevator, he asks her if any of their relationship was real. Getting specific, Daniel recalls when he proposed to Emily, saying “Was that real? You had to have been in that moment.” (Aw!) She admits there were real feelings, until Daniel decided to take sides with his dad, Conrad. That’s when it all went south, she said. (Could there be hope for them yet?)</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Emily leaves the elevator and finds a bunch of photos of Amanda in a safety deposit box. I’m assuming it was owned by David, but somewhere along the way I missed&nbsp;where she got a key from. These pictures rock Emily to the core. Clearly, David was spying on Amanda for the past couple of years. Emily sheds a tear or two and looks super jealous.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Margaux&nbsp;uses her intuition and realizes that Daniel slept with Louise. She throws a glass of champagne in his face and storms out. Oh, and she also assumes Louise tried to kill her. I may not like Margaux, but her gut is usually always right.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Nolan, who is still upset after <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>David blasted him on live TV</a>, ends up buying the beach club. (Fun!)</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>Meanwhile, David and Victoria are having a romantic moment on the couch (barf!) when Emily bursts in! David is clearly shocked by this abrupt entrance, but Emily demands answers! She slaps the pile of pictures down on the table and asks David why he didn’t come for her. He seems confused, but then grabs her arm and sees the infinity tattoo. Emily then asks again, “why didn’t you come for me?” When he finally realizes Emily is truly Amanda, Victoria runs outside and gets electrocuted by a fallen wire. (Typical Victoria — she always needs to have all the attention on her.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Sadly, Victoria’s fate hangs in the balance. Until next week, that is…</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>What do YOU think, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>? Are you happy Emily finally told David the truth? Do you think Victoria died? Tell us how you feel!</p><p id=content-paragraph-21><strong>— Chris Rogers</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-22><a class=twitter-follow-button href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Follow @ChrisRogers86</a></p><h3>More ‘Revenge’ News:</h3><li><a href=#>‘Revenge’ Recap: David Clarke Attacks Nolan Ross On Live TV</a></li><li>‘Revenge’ Recap: Victoria Grayson & Margaux LeMarchal Join Forces</li><li>‘Revenge’: Madeleine Stowe Teases More Drama Between Victoria & Emily</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlkZH5ye5BpZqudppq7qLGMq5ycmaBisq61y7JkraCfp7umecOaraKcXZi5or7KnmSrnaWjtrC6jJqkmqaUlnqkuMCrop5lo5qws7HTaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jodie-sweetin-daughter-looks-like-mom-14th-birthday-tribute-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jodie Sweetins Daughter Looks Just Like Mom In 14th Birthday Tribute Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./coin-collector-tesco-fuel-compensation-police.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Collector arrested for using 100 coin to buy fuel at Tesco wins 5,000 payout</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
