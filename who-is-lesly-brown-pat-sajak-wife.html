However, the two didn't see sparks fly straight away. "There was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>no electricity</a> in the air," Sajak recalled in an interview with PEOPLE in the early '90s. He looked over at Brown and teased, "The subject of you didn't come up in my car ride home."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After their initial meeting, Sajak and Brown became friends. The two would talk on the phone and hang out, but "it wasn't romantic," as Brown told PEOPLE. Several months later, however, feelings started to develop.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-appeared-on-the-dating-show-and-it-made-sajak-jealous></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She appeared on </strong><strong>The Dating Show</strong><strong> and it made Sajak jealous</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ron Galella, Ltd./Ron Galella Collection</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Sajak and Brown were navigating their feelings, Brown was selected as a contestant on a reality show called The Dating Show. She ended up going on a trip to Mexico with the bachelor who had chosen her on the show — and that stirred things up with Sajak. "Frankly, I was a little annoyed at that," he told PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There was definitely borderline jealousy.

A few months later, the two exchanged vows in front of close family and friends at a Catholic church in Annapolis, Maryland. The reception was held nearby, in the backyard of Brown's parents' house.
