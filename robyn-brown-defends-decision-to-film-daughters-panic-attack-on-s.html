air.</p><p>"Aurora started having real panic attacks when things got super stressful when were told we had to move," Tweeted her mom, adding:</p><p>"It was hard for her to think about moving again and she had a lot going on since it was her Junior year. It was super hard to see her struggle."</p><p>Yes, it absolutely must have been.</p><p>But that doesn’t answer the question of why a young woman’s panic attack was turned into fodder for a reality TV show. Isn’t it a parent’s responsibility to shield her child from this kind of thing?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"Aurora was given the choice whether to let her panic attack be included on the show," Robyn added in response to the backlash, saying in more detail:</p><p>"She just wanted to be able to talk about what it is like to have a panic attack too. She wants to bring awareness so people are more sensitive and supportive to those who have them."</p><p>If this second point is true, then we applaud Aurora for being so open about what she goes through.</p><p>We’re just a little cynical when it comes to programs of this nature — and it’s hard not to wonder whether producers pressured Aurora to give them the greenlight because her attack made for good content.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/kody-brown-gives-a-confessional.png><p>Concluded Robyn on this subject, giving fans more context:</p><p>She has seen doctors to help her and we did a lot to support her through everything she was going through.&nbsp; She is so accomplished and still is doing very well in school.&nbsp;</p><p>She is my over achiever and expects a lot of herself.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a very stressful hard time for her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The scene in question was difficult to watch for most fans.</p><p>It took place after Kody and Robyn had gathered their five kids to tell them that the rental home they had been living in was recently sold.</p><p>They had 60 days to move out and find another house in Flagstaff, while Robyn and Kody argued in front of their children about whether renting another home or buying a home was the best option for their family.&nbsp;</p><p>In the middle of their debate, Robyn noticed that Aurora had started to twitch, which is one of the first signs of an impendiing panic attack.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In a confessional, the teenager opened up about what it feels like when she’s going through this sort of thing.</p><p>“It’s like, difficult to think and process things cause it feels like my thoughts are simultaneously going a million miles an hour and nowhere at all,” she explained.</p><p>“These panic attacks happen probably four to five times a week. Some of them, I have noticed, are triggered by certain things like when I’m really, really upset or really like emotionally or physically exhausted or when I have a high stress situation.</p><p>‘My shoulders and torso will start to shake and I’ll start to have tremors and stuff. By the time I’m in the middle of one, I’m like hyperventilating and I can’t talk and I can’t walk and I can’t do hardly anything for myself.</p><p>"I still struggle to convince myself that I’m not the one causing it. I’m not the one instigating it and knowing that it’s not my fault. It’s not a bad thing, it’s just hard.”</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Sister Wives Secrets Spilled: What Did Kody Brown Reveal?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2WAcL7Om7CnZZKnvLi6jJ2cn52emcBusMScoKyhn6N6tbuMn6ClpV2Zrrazx62cq6tdpa6vtcJmmK2skZi4brvNZqpo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tv-characters-halloween-costumes-20122510.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>TV Characters' Best Halloween Costumes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-many-cigarettes-in-elf-bar.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How many cigarettes are in an Elf Bar?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
