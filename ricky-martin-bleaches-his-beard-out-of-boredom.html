Photographer <strong>Jeremy Kost</strong> teased, “Blondes have more fun.” And model Y<strong>aya Kosikova Oliver</strong> had a styling suggestion. “I would bleach the hair too! Would suit you even more! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👌🏻”</p><p>Meanwhile, Modern Family star <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jesse Tyler Ferguson</strong></a> joked, “This is what my beard looks like when I DON’T dye it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Ricky-Martin-Bleaches-His-Beard-Out-Of-Boredom-Because-Why-Not-Promo.jpg><p>The “Livin’ la Vida Loca” singer isn’t the only star to play around with their appearance when bored. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. One of our favorite major transformations was <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Blake Shelton</strong></a> bringing back his mullet.</p><p>Back in March 2020, the country star, 43, shared via Twitter that he was bringing back his ‘90s hairstyle with the help of his now-fiancée <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Gwen Stefani</strong></a>.</p><p>“I have an announcement. With basically EVERYTHING I had scheduled being canceled for the foreseeable further @gwenstefani and I have made a decision together,” he wrote to his fans on Twitter. “I am growing my mullet back as a symbol of hope or some shit like that.. Anyway it’s coming back! For real. Stay tuned…”</p><p>A few weeks later, he <a href=# rel=noopener>posted an update</a> via Twitter. “Quarantine mullet update 3/26/2020,” he wrote in the Tweet. “@gwenstefani has decided to take it to the next level.. Stripes.” In the accompanying pic, The Voice judges’ has buzzed sides with three lines and a bit of gray.</p><p>He later revealed during an appearance on the<a href=# rel=noopener> Ellen Degeneres Show </a>that after seeing this picture, he decided to buy a box of Just For Men hair dye.</p><p>“I said, ‘Oh, God, when did this happen to me?’” <a href=# rel=noopener>he recalled</a> “I was like, ‘Oh, my God, it’s completely white! How have I not noticed this? I’m on television all the time. I’m on a show,” The Voice judge shared. “How did I not see that I look like a game show host all the sudden?’”</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn’t quite know how to do it. “I tried that for a while but I wasn’t doing it right,” he said. “It had too much color. It was like blue or purple or something.”</p><p>Luckily the former No Doubt band member stepped in and played around with his strands. After all, he didn’t have any professional engagements or public outings planned. As he put it, “That was the time to mess around.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities’ street style ‘dos (and don’ts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6e2pLfYZqSaqqSeu26uy56YnKCVqHqptdJmmZ6Zopl6sMHTZqafZZKkv6awzqZm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amber-sienna-age-height-movie.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Batman Star Amber Siennas Age, Height, And Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-dempster.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Dempster Bio: Career &amp;amp; Net Worth [2023 Update]</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
