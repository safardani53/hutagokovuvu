I’m gonna get a cab.’ And I’m like, ‘Don’t do that. It’s way too late,’” he&nbsp;recalled. “’Take the guest bedroom.’”</p><p>The model did — and when her future husband checked on her later that night, she rebuffed his advances.

After rejecting him two more times, she finally agreed to come over for dinner, and that — finally — won her over.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The couple <a href=#>welcomed</a> son Levi and daughter Vida before they ultimately tied the knot in June 2012.
