He <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married</a> high school pal <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cherry Seaborn</strong></a> in 2019 after reconnecting in 2015, and they have since welcomed two children together.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Cherry’s struggles with the second pregnancy are part of the Ed Sheeran: The Sum Of It All docuseries on Disney+. In the first episode, “Cherry gets life-altering news, and Ed quickly realizes that plans can change in an instant and he will have to adapt,” per the episode’s description. The story has a happy ending, but the journey there takes quite a toll on Ed, as the documentary shows.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Read on to learn all there is to know about Ed and Cherry’s two daughters.</p><h2>Lyra Antarctica Seaborn Sheeran</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Ed and Cherry’s first daughter was born in late August 2020. Reports that they were expecting a child only broke in mid-August, as Ed and Cherry were able to hide their pregnancy with the help of lockdowns caused by the coronavirus pandemic. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ed announced the birth</a> of Lyra on Instagram on Sept. 1, 2020. “Ello! A quick message from me as I have some personal news that I wanted to share with you… Last week, with the help of an amazing delivery team, Cherry gave birth to our beautiful and healthy daughter – Lyra Antarctica Seaborn Sheeran,” he gushed. “We are completely in love with her. Both mum and baby are doing amazing, and we are on cloud nine over here. We hope that you can respect our privacy at this time. Lots of love and I’ll see you when it’s time to come back, Ed x.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Ed and Cherry have never posted a photo of their daughter, but Ed was spotted walking with her in a baby carrier in London less than two months after she was welcomed into the world. The pictures, obtained by the Daily Mail, can be seen <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>. The publication reported that Lyra’s name is inspired by the character Lyra Belacqua, who is the heroine of Ed’s favorite book series, His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman. The outlet also said her middle name may pay homage to where she was conceived, as Ed and Cherry had gone on a trip to Antarctica “exactly” nine months before she was born.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>While fans may not know what Ed and Cherry’s bundle of joy looks like, it is known that she is healthy and happy. Well, besides when she hears her dad singing, apparently. In a May 2021 interview, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ed claimed Lyra doesn’t like hearing his new songs</a> and “just cries” when he plays them. He said she enjoys his 2017 hit single “Shape of you,” though. “The marimba sound is good, but she doesn’t like anything loud or anything belt-y,” he added. And in November of that year, he revealed she started to walk and talk, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>. He also claimed Lyra’s first word was “dad,” although he admitted he wasn’t sure if that’s an accurate belief.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>In June 2021, the “Shivers” singer <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>said</a> being a dad was the “best thing that’s ever happened” to him. He added, “I think there are so many different sides and shapes to it. There are difficult days, there are amazing, easy days. It’s just a rollercoaster of emotions. I know that sounds like a cliché thing to say, but it’s amazing. I love it.”</p><h2>Jupiter</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Ed and Cherry secretly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed their second daughter</a> into the world in May 2022, and Ed took to Instagram once again to announce the exciting news. “Want to let you all know we’ve had another beautiful baby girl,” he wrote. “We are both so in love with her and over the moon to be a family of 4 x.” The photo he shared was a pair of white baby socks lying on an ombré brown blanket. He did not immediately share the name of his newborn. In June, Ed, Cherry, and Lyra took their<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> new family member for a walk</a>, marking the first time the newborn was seen in public. In March 2023,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;</a><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a>&nbsp;confirmed the name of the child after numerous reports:&nbsp;<strong>Jupiter</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>That month, Ed also shared that Cherry was diagnosed with a tumor while pregnant with their second child. “Within the space of a month, my pregnant wife got told she had a tumor with no route to treatment until after the birth,” <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ed shared</a>. “My best friend Jamal, a brother to me, died suddenly, and I found myself standing in court defending my integrity and career as a songwriter. I was spiraling through fear, depression, and anxiety. I felt like I was drowning, head below the surface, looking up but not being able to break through for air.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8SdZKyglZq%2ForqMpKCdq11phHV9l2tsaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./birthday-dress-went-viral-ugly-people-horrendous-fashion.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>My birthday dress went viral for being 'ugly' - people said it was 'horrendous' but they just don't</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./drop-dead-diva-cast-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here's What the Actors Are Up To</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
