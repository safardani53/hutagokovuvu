While we're dealing with a ton of negative feelings that range from anger, bitterness, depression, and a sudden urge to live out in the wilderness as a recluse who sustains themselves off the fat of the lang, there are some helpful tips one can take to ensure that they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">process it in a healthy manner</a>.</p><p>However, over-thinking things can also lend to self-seriousness, and how one conducts themselves in the face of adversity, as corny and afternoon school special as it might sound, is the true definition of a person's character.</p><p>And it appears that the way TikToker <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@swedishswan</a> handled a rejection letter from a company she really wanted to work at made her prospective employers have a change of heart.</p><p>She says in a now-viral video on the popular social media platform that after receiving several job rejection emails, she didn't know what to do. "I really kind of wanted this job, so I took a lesson from Gen Z," she said.</p><p>So instead of sending back a traditional "thank you for the opportunity" form email, or verbally writing out ways she could improve or ask for an explanation as to why/how she could improve and what made them render their decision, she cut straight to the heart of the matter with a meme.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@swedishswan href=#>@swedishswan</a><p><a title=greenscreen href=#>#greenscreen</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - SwedishSwan" href=#>♬ original sound - SwedishSwan</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @swedishswan</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It's one</a> you've probably seen while scrolling through the internet: it's a strange painting by artist Medellin, Colombia artist and sculptor Fernando Botero of Pope Leon X.
