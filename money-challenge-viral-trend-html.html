In the caption, he teased the release day of his new music writing "1/21/22 you ready?" <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It was now Lil Durk's turn to send a response. And he did, in the same style&nbsp;YoungBoy sent his threats.</p><p>Lil Durk took to Instagram two days after YoungBoy's post to send out his own message.</p><p>"Hurry yall [expletive] azz up," wrote the rapper on a staircase while hiding his face behind some bills in his hand. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>This viral trend has now caught on and everyone is using the "spell out words with cash" technique to send their messages.</p><h2>'Money Challenge's Origins and adopters</h2><p>Despite it looking like it was YoungBoy and Lil Durk who set off the Money Challenge trend, digging a bit deeper reveals that they might just be the rejuvenators of the viral trend.</p><p>There are two main candidates&nbsp;who claim to have <a href=# rel="follow noopener">started the practice</a> — <a href=# rel=follow>50 Cent</a> and <a href=# rel=follow>SouljaBoy</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Just days after the trend caught on, 50 Cent posted an old picture on Instagram.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">irony-exuding photo</a>, 50 Cent is sat beside wads of $100 bills that spell out "BROKE."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In the caption, he seemingly takes the credit for the trend, saying, "when I look back at some of the [expletive]&nbsp;that I did, I be bugging out."</p><p>Nevertheless, he admitted he liked what everyone else was doing with the trend now. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>SouljaBoy also entered the race to claim that he started the trend. On January 23, 2022, he sent out a tweet with a screenshot from one of his music videos from March 2016.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>At the 5-second mark of his 'Stacks On Deck' video, his name is shown spelled out with $20 notes.</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>A screengrab from SouljaBoy's 'Stacks On Deck' music video helping his&nbsp;claims&nbsp;for starting viral 'Money Challenge' trend.</strong> (Photo: SouljaBoy/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</p><p>In the tweet, he wrote, "I was the first rapper spelling with money LOL."</p><p>Since the trend has gone viral, many others have given in to their urges to spell with&nbsp;wads of cash. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>A few of the adopters of this new and showboat-y way of relaying messages are rapper Future;&nbsp;Doodie Lo, who spelled "<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">She Lied</a>" with moeny to hit out at his ex-girlfriend;&nbsp;Fivio Foreign, who <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">expressed his disapproval</a> of child support payments;&nbsp;and Coi Leray Collins, who just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spelled her</a> Instagram name 'Big Trend Setter'&nbsp;with cash.</p><p>Not everyone liked the trend, though. Wiz Khalifa sent out a cautionary tweet saying, "Don't go broke tryna count that money on tha floor." Nick Cannon had his own funny way of disapproval, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spelling out</a> "IRS watchin" with not cash but toilet paper.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWfo7K6ecKhmKWklaO0pnnVoqmapF2pv6a6w2efraWc</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./candis-cayne-5-things-to-know-caitlyn-jenner-mentor-2015157.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Candis Cayne: 5 Things to Know About Caitlyn Jenner's Mentor</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./summer-labutte.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Summer LaButte- Age, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Height, Ethnicity</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
