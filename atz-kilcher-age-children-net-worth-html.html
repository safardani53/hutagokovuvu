Like most families, Thanksgiving is a handed down celebration and since the Kilchers are awash in family traditions as well, each person from the family brought something special to share to the dinner table. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr></p><p dir=ltr><strong>Like Father Like Son:</strong> Atz Senior and Junior look at the table while planning&nbsp;the next cut on Alaska: The Last Frontier (Photo: Discovery)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p dir=ltr>The week before, Atz’s son encountered a predator while building a bridge in the backcountry and Otto Kilcher’s hay season nearly came to a cease when a broken tractor compelled him to get creative.</p><p dir=ltr>Coming back to the topic of Thanksgiving, Atz and his family built their own trestle table for the big family feast. He had been busy putting together long pieces of lumber in an attempt to make a larger trestle table to hold the whole family while describing the table he wanted to make,</p><p dir=ltr>This is a trestle table, so instead of four legs you just kind of have two little walls, one at each end… then to keep those from wobbling, you put the trestle in between when it all comes together. Pretty cool!</p><p dir=ltr>Finally, after a long time of crafting and designing, the heirloom quality of the table was ready and Shane went to the extent of saying that the table would be historical in their family legend. And there’s no doubt about that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5bBu3nKoqOcoJWneqKzxGaaoaGcmb%2BmuoynnK1lp6S%2FtbSNoaumpA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./trader-joes-discontinued-items.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Eight items you will no longer see at Trader Joe's in 2023 - so grab them if you can</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./buffy-the-vampire-slayer-where-are-they-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title></p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
