And so he found himself <a href=#>dismissing many of Wickes’ customers as “bigots” who are “not welcome in our stores”</a>. Wow.</p><p>The reason he says that Wickes does not want the custom of all the ­general public is because Wickes has decided to go huge on the <a href=#>trans </a>issue.</p><p>&nbsp;It is an issue which is deeply ­divisive among gay people, and even more divisive for women.</p><p>At a rally in Brighton last year, representatives from Wickes carried a ­banner saying “No LGB without the T” — referencing the claim that gay people are now expected to ignore biology and instead believe in gender ideology.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>&nbsp;This month Wickes changed its logos online to show the “Pride” flag — a flag that has changed in recent years and which many now believe has nothing at all to do with being gay.</p><p>&nbsp;The “Pride” flag has become more of a way to denote political “progressivism”. As though believing men can become women if they put on lipstick and heels is remotely “progressive”.</p><p>In any case, when asked about his company’s strong stance on trans issues, Longden said: “I don’t think I’m ever going to change some of the bigots’ minds out there.</p><p>“I’m never going to win that argument with them, so we were doing it to show support to the community.” After being asked about whether he feared a boycott of Wickes stores for his pushing of trans issues, he said that most of the population are “slightly ignorant” about trans issues but come from a “kind position”, adding: “The other ten per cent, you know — they’re just hot air and they will go and buy a tin of paint in the nearest place to them.”</p><p>In other words, take that you mugs.</p><h2>Traditional, obvious truths</h2><p>&nbsp;You may not like having the ­rainbow flag shoved in your face.</p><p>&nbsp;You may not be totally cool with abusing confused <a href=#>children in the name of trans rights</a>. But next time you need a tin of paint, you’ll come crawling back to Wickes.</p><p>Personally I don’t think I ever want to shop there again.</p><p>&nbsp;I’ve long thought the company’s stores to be overpriced and badly staffed, with poor products. But next time I need a pot of paint I will go out of my way to shop elsewhere.</p><p>First, because like the majority of people in this country, I am all for tolerance and all for minority rights.</p><p>&nbsp;But I also believe in majority rights.</p><p>Trans ideology is no longer simply about being accepting of a tiny ­number of people who think they are in the wrong body. It is an ideology which pushes the idea that there is no such thing as <a href=#>biological sex</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;It is a movement designed to ­confuse people and to take apart ­traditional, obvious truths. In fact, it tries to destroy the first truth we know as a species. Which is that there are boys and girls. I see nothing “progressive” about telling children they can change sex and alter their bodies as though we are made of Lego.</p><p>This is a dangerous, child-abusing movement.</p><p>People who object to this, like me, should be heard out.</p><p>&nbsp;We should not simply be dismissed as “bigots”.</p><p>The concerns that many people — especially women — have about the trans movement are real.</p><p>&nbsp;There are genuine problems with ­biological men accessing women’s spaces, everywhere from bathrooms to prisons and women’s shelters.</p><p>To pretend that “trans rights” are obvious and not contestable is ­actually the bigoted position.</p><p>But the second reason I’ll avoid Wickes in future is simply that I don’t want corporations to tell me what to think.</p><p>I don’t want companies to involve themselves in “culture war” issues.</p><p>&nbsp;I wouldn’t want them to be pro-trans and I wouldn’t want them to be anti-trans. I don’t want them to fly a “Pride” flag, just as I wouldn’t want them to fly a “shame” flag.</p><p>These companies have one job to do.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2004-ratner-away-uk-retail-1925439.jpg><p>&nbsp;Which is to sell paint and other products to the public.</p><p>&nbsp;That’s it. Nothing else.</p><p>&nbsp;I don’t want to get my politics from Wickes, I just want to get a reasonably priced and decent pot of paint.</p><p>But that seems to be something Wickes has decided is not a priority.</p><p>&nbsp;Instead of focusing on providing the best possible service, Wickes has decided to tell the public what to think and decided to call us bigots if we don’t agree.</p><p>Well, if they want to get involved in political issues then they’ll have to learn the hard way that the public can vote.</p><p>And on Wickes we’re already voting with our feet.</p><p>&nbsp;As the news emerged, Wickes’ share price fell by more than four per cent.</p><p>So, as I say, a Ratner moment.</p><p>&nbsp;And a learning moment for other companies who forget the new adage: Go woke, go broke.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>School gender dunces</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NINTCHDBPICT000826145821.jpg><p>THE only thing worse than a stupid idea is a stupid idea picked up by stupid people.</p><p>I’ve just listened to the tape recording of a 13-year-old girl at Rye College in East Sussex having an argument with her teacher.</p><p>&nbsp;The Year 8 class was having a “life education” lesson in which their incredibly dim teacher kept telling them that you can be “who you want to be and how you identify is up to you”.</p><p>A pupil asked: “How can you identify as a cat when you’re a girl?”</p><p>The confused teacher kept trying to repeat the mantras of the gender movement.</p><p>&nbsp;The pupil said that there are just boys and girls. The teacher kept claiming that there is a mysterious thing called “gender” and that ­mentioning biological sex was bigoted.</p><p>&nbsp;The pupil was 100 per cent right. The teacher was 100 per cent wrong.</p><p>But <a href=#>the teacher ended up reporting the pupil</a> and saying she would not be welcome at the school.</p><p>Consider this. Rye ­College is a Church of England school.</p><p>&nbsp;This is what they are teaching pupils.</p><p>If you care about your kids, find out if they are being taught this cr*p.</p><p>And if they are then stand up for them and against the teachers who are mis-educating them.</p><p>ANOTHER day and another new video of <a href=#>Partygate</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;This time it is of some CCHQ staffers during Boris ­Johnson’s time in office having a very unenjoyable-looking ­gathering in December 2020.</p><p>I get it.</p><p>I loathe the idea that while we were all being nannied by Downing Street, told who to meet and when, the staff at Conservative Party headquarters were ­gathering for wine and crisps.</p><p>&nbsp;It is the height of hypocrisy.</p><p>But the leaks and videos have been enough. Boris Johnson has already been chased not just out of Downing Street but out of the House of Commons.</p><p><a href=#>&nbsp;That should be an end of it.</a></p><p>We have bigger things to focus on as a country.</p><p>&nbsp;Looking in the rear-view mirror at a crash that has already ­happened is unhealthy.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Bow out with dignity, Biden</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fa2fa178-5288-4de4-a834-ddaebab77416.jpg><p>DODDERY <a href=#>Joe Biden</a> surprised his ­audience in Connecticut at the weekend.</p><p>Although the President managed not to fall over during his speech, he did finish it with a bizarre stumble.</p><p>&nbsp;After rambling away, he finally closed by saying: “God save the <a href=#>Queen</a>.”</p><p>What? It is very nice of Biden to remember our late monarch. But what on earth?</p><p>The truth is that as each day goes by it becomes clearer and clearer that the 80-year old President doesn’t know what day of the week it is.
