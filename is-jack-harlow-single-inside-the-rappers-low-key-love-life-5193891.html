He and Dua were dating in late 2022, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>Page Six</i></a>, but it appeared that their romance fizzled out some time in early 2023. The outlet reported that Jack was going to “strongly pursue” her and insiders claimed he met up with her in New York City after she performed at the Z100 Jingle Ball in 2022.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>One of the most telling signs of their apparent relationship was when Jack released a song named after Dua on his album Come Home the Kids Miss You. While discussing the track on the “Breakfast Club” podcast in 2022, the “First Class” rapper revealed that he contacted the “Dance the Night” singer about the song.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/dua-lipa-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I played it for her because I didn’t want her to be blindsided by it or feel creeped out or anything,” he explained. “If she’d said, ‘I hate it, I don’t want it to come out,’ it wouldn’t have come out.” After Jack was asked whether he “fancied” Dua, he replied, “I admire her. When the song comes out, I think she’ll grow to appreciate it even more.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The track includes a lyric that is a sweet shout-out to the Grammy Award winner: “Dua Lipa, I’m tryna do more with her than do a feature (do it).”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Earlier that year, Jack told <i>Rolling Stone</i> that he was open to an exclusive relationship with someone, noting, “I’m always looking for the one.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Addison Rae</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Addison</a> quickly shut down relationship rumors between her and Jack by taking to X (formerly known as Twitter) to note, “I’m single.” Speculation about the TikTok star and the rapper swirled after a rumor surfaced claiming they were holding hands at a boxing match in 2021.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/addison-rae-embed.jpg><h2>Saweetie <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>While Jack and Saweetie never confirmed they ever dated, fans caught the two of them having what appeared to be a flirty exchange.
