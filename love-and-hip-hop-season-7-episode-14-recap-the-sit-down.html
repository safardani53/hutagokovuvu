You don’t know both sides.”</p><p>Kimbella wanted to know what the other side was, so she asked Kim.&nbsp;</p><p>Kim tells her “Erika and Samantha have invited Yandy to things that she has not come to.”</p><p>Kimbella says “Can we all get-together and sort all of this out so that the kids can be together?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/yandy-smith-looking-good.jpg><p>The ladies came to an understanding that they would do their best to have the women put the drama behind them.&nbsp;</p><p>We switched gears over to Drewski and Sky, who were having some serious issues in their relationship. Sky revealed to the audience that she was now living with her mother.&nbsp;</p><p>She met with Drewski because he wanted to try and make things right between them. When Drewski arrived, Sky was getting up close and personal with another dude.&nbsp;</p><p>This rubbed him the wrong way as it was evident she was trying to make him jealous.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/kimbella-still-looks-good-1024x558.png><p>He tells her “I want to make things right with you and this is what you do?”</p><p>Sky revealed that she was hurt by the video posted online and would be doing her best to make sure her man was jealous.&nbsp;</p><p>While one relationship was crumbling, another was blossoming. Swift stopped by the studio to let Cardi B know that he was into her.&nbsp;</p><p>“My feelings have grown for you and I really think that we could do great things.”</p><p>Cardi was floored by this random declaration, but she was not interested in pursuing a relationship.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/tensions-are-falring-on-love-and-hip-hop-1024x543.png><p>“I don’t want us to get together because if you do me wrong, I would wish you bad, and I pray for your come up,” Cardi replied. &nbsp;</p><p>Swift countered “Why do you think I would do you bad?”</p><p>Cardi barked “I just worry about jumping from one relationship to another.”</p><p>Later, Yandy met up with Kimbella at a photo shoot to chat about the meeting. Yandy&nbsp;was quick to open up about her reasons for not attending.</p><p>“I was coming to the party with Judy and the kids when I heard all of this commotion, so I turned around and left.” Kimbella laughs and says “I was the commotion!”</p><p>Yandy was disappointed that Kimbella was the root of the argument.&nbsp;</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>15 AMAZING Moments from Love & Hip Hop</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>Kimbella said, “I met with Kim the next day, and we agreed that there needs to be a meeting with all of us so that we can work this out.”</p><p>Yandy reluctantly agreed to the meeting.&nbsp;</p><p>We returned to Drewski, who was trying to make things right with Sky. He was at her mother’s house, apologizing.&nbsp;</p><p>“I accept your apology, but I am still sleeping here at my mom’s house.”&nbsp;</p><p>At that moment, a car rocked up. It was a white Mercedes. Sky was ecstatic, but her happiness quickly turned to rage when Drewski told her to change her number.&nbsp;</p><p>“I thought you didn’t want me riding a motorcycle in the winter. You buying me this car is just you trying to control me.”&nbsp;</p><p>The scorned woman hurled her glass of wine in his face, and that appeared to be the end of them.&nbsp;</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Best Reality TV Fights of 2016</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>Finally, the women met up to hash out their differences. It was going well until Kimbella&nbsp;started throwing Mendeecees&nbsp;under the bus and blaming him for all of the trouble.&nbsp;</p><p>“If all of you know that he is a cheater and wasn’t faithful to any of you then why are you sitting here fighting over him?” Samantha speaks up and says “It’s not about Mendecees, it’s about the kids.”</p><p>Judy got up to leave because she did not want her son trashed while she was there.&nbsp;</p><p>And that’s another season in the can, you guys!
