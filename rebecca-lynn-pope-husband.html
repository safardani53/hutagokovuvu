With their weddings already planned, the men are forced to choose between saying "I do" on the spot or walking away from their relationship completely. Life coach <a href=#>Rebecca Lynn Pope</a> is the mastermind helping these women orchestrate it all â€” but is she married herself? Keep reading to learn more about her husband, Kerry.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>First, a little background on the host herself is in order. Rebecca is a life coach who specializes in relationships, spiritual healing, confidence coaching, business coaching, and leadership development. Additionally, she's a published author (her 2017 book is titled Love and Dating in the 21st Century: A Godly Girl's Guide) and a motivational speaker.</p><p>But that's not all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Rebecca and her husband co-founded Abundant Life Path University.</h2><p>Alongside her husband <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kerry Pope</a>, Rebecca is the co-owner of Abundant Life Path, where she trains other coaches and offers spiritual advising to women around the world.

"Seven years ago today, Kerry saw me on a friend's Facebook post and asked who I was. He inboxed me, got my number, and we spoke on the phone for the first time that same day," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she wrote</a>. "We had our first date three days later. We got married 16 months later!"</p><p>She continued: "Ya'll better stop ignoring those inbox messages and stop saying that technology sucks and you don't want to meet people from dating apps or social media!!! Where do you think everyone is at ... ON THEIR PHONES!"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In another post, Rebecca raved about what a great partner Terry is for her, writing: "This man right here ... Ladies, don't overlook the smart, reserved, giving, strong, and sensitive men in your life! They make the best lovers, husbands, and fathers. This man is my blessing after going through hell!!!."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Rebecca Lynn Pope have children?</h2><p>Neither Rebecca nor Kerry share photos of their children on social media. However, Rebecca has given her husband shoutouts for Father's Day, alluding to the fact that they do have kids together. In June 2022, she wrote on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>: "Happy Father's Day Kerry A. Pope! Thank you for being a shining example of God, love, hard work, spirituality, strength, and kindness to all of our children.
