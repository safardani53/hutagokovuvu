Gradually people become more tired, more weary.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Wellbeing</h2></p><p>“As time goes by people sleep more and they’re awake less.”</p><p>Dr Mannix suggested that dying is just a state of unconsciousness - and if you’ve ever been unconscious, you’ll know it was not scary.&nbsp;</p><p>She said: “Families can learn when to give medicines and when to introduce visitors. Sometimes a visitor might happen or a medicine might be due during that sleep.</p><p>“And that is when we can discover that a change has taken place, it’s tiny but it’s really significant - and it’s that instead of just being asleep, this person has temporarily become unconscious.</p><p>“We can’t wake them up, we can’t give them that medicine. We can’t tell them that visitor is here.</p><p>“Yet when they wake later on, they tell us they’ve had a good sleep, so we know that this coma doesn’t feel frightening. That lapsing into unconsciousness just isn't noticed by us when it happens.</p><p>“So as time goes by, people are awake less and asleep more until eventually they’re just unconscious all the time.”</p><p>Dr Mannix said the “death rattle” - a distinctive crackling sound that a person may make as they are coming to the end of their life as they are no longer to swallow or <a href=#>cough</a> - can be comforting.</p><p>She said: “People talk about the death rattle as if it’s something terrible but actually it tells me that my patient is so deeply relaxed, so deeply unconscious that they’re not even feeling that tickle of saliva as the air bubbles in and out through it from their lungs.”</p><p>“So at the very end of somebody’s life, there will be a period of shallow breathing and then one ‘out breath’ that just isn’t followed by another ‘in breath’. Sometimes it’s so gentle that families don’t even notice that it’s happened.”</p><p>Meanwhile, in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok video gone viral</a>, an ICU nurse revealed what she’d learnt about death having “sat with a lot of people in the last moments of their life” in her work.</p><p>Known only as Ryann, she said: “Death is not scary. Some patients do experience a lot of fear up until the moment that they die. But in the moments of actual death, it's incredibly peaceful.</p><p>“Even in traumatic deaths, when we stop resuscitation attempts, there is an eerie calm while the patient actually passes away.”</p><p>She explained that during her career, she has discovered people sometimes have control over when they finally pass.</p><p>Ryann said: “A big one I believe is people don't die until they want to die. We will have patients survive insurmountable odds while they're waiting for a certain family member to show up, or to leave, and instantly they'll pass on.</p><p>“A lot of patients need permission to die. Some patients want to know certain loved ones will be okay.</p><p>“So despite all the physical anomalies, these patients seem to have some sort of control at the end of their life.”</p><h2>Time for us to talk about dying</h2><p>While grief is undoubtedly awful for families, both medics said people do not talk about death itself enough.</p><p>Ryann said: “I've learnt not enough people talk about death, at least realistically, so the majority of people don't really know what it looks like, and that makes discussing end of life choices really difficult.”</p><p>Dr Mannix said this is “a bit of a problem for us” because it creates a “sadness and anxiety” around someone's last moments.</p><p>She said: “A family will sit around the bed of someone so sick that they will be dying, and not know what to say.</p><p>“Not know what to say to each other, not know what to say to the dying person, and the dying person doesn't know what to say either, wondering whether each breath might be their last breath.</p><p>“A scene of sadness, anxiety and despair… and in my humble opinion, it doesn’t need to be like that at all.”</p><p>Dr Mannix, believing that we need to normalise conversations in order to console each other in the best ways that we possibly can, said: “So normal human dying - just a really gentle process.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>“Something that we can recognise, something that we can prepare for, something that we can manage and this should be something that we can celebrate.</p><p>“This is something that we should be able to console each other with. But because it’s become impolite to talk about dying, it’s the really best kept secret in medicine.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIB3gZBvbWxnp52utXnRnpilpKlitaK8z56lrGWUnrJuw8eyZKygn6q5pbrTZqqcmaKasXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./home-bargains-shoppers-rave-washing-up-bowl-drain-cheaper-john-lewis.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Home Bargains shoppers rave about its utterly brilliant 2.99 washing up bowl &amp;amp; its 2</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./marko-milun.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Marko Milun net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
