Amanda made their debut on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days in June, alongside her beau Razvan Coicoi. Amanda is a recently widowed mom from Indiana, who lost her husband, Jason, in 2022. Amanda opened up about Jason’s death during the June 4 episode of 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days and revealed that he died just days after receiving his ampullary cancer diagnosis.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Amanda later met Razvan on TikTok Live. She came across his page while participating in a social media challenge with her friend and the two eventually connected offline. Shortly after their first interaction, Amanda traveled to Romania to meet Razvan but her trip was far from perfect. While away, Amanda received a call from her children which made her feel guilty about the international trip.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/7D1FfM7Ex/200x200/darrell-marrow-distractify-1679433942049.jpg><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“I feel guilty for leaving my kids. But, I need to see if this is the right guy to bring into my kids' life, to, you know, have a future with,” Amanda said. The pair later got into conflict after Amanda refused to appear in Razvan’s music video and the drama continued. However, long before Amanda appeared on reality television, she was involved in a very serious incident. Here’s everything we know about Amanda’s arrest.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why was '90 Day Fiancé' star Amanda Wilhelm arrested?</h2><p>Prior to joining the 90 Day Fiancé, Amanda faced heinous criminal charges. According to a police report obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In Touch</a>, Amanda was arrested in 2010 for assaulting a woman named Kayla Patton with a baseball bat. Amanda and an accomplice, Jeremiah ​Means, reportedly wrestled Kayla to the ground before the reality star unleashed a vicious attack.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“Amanda Green repeatedly and intentionally struck Kayla with her hands and wrestled Kayla to the ground,” a court affidavit reads. “Causing abrasions on Kayla’s left knee and both elbows, causing redness and bleeding.” Amanda later told officers that she witnessed Kayla, along with a girl named Kristine, “walking down the road” near her home. Amanda claimed that she later asked Jeremiah to travel with her to Kayla’s house to resolve their issue.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to Amanda, Kayla attacked her with a bat when the 90 Day Fiancé newcomer exited the vehicle, prompting a physical altercation. And while Amanda claimed she was defending herself, officers explained that it was “clear” that the then 19-year-old committed a crime. Amanda’s sentence was later deferred, and she was ordered to complete community service.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When did Amanda’s husband Jason die?</h2><p>Amanda’s arrest isn't the only thing she is receiving flack for. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans</a> of 90 Day Fiancé have taken to social media to criticize the Indiana resident for moving on months after her husband Jason’s death. After getting wind of the backlash, Amanda took to Instagram to clarify details about her relationship with Razvan.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>“My late husband and I were together for 12 years and married 8," Amanda wrote (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Screen Rant</a>). "He passed away early 2022 — filming for the show took place end of 2022 early 2023.” She explained that her kids simply knew Razvan as her “friend,” following her husband’s death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrqiusOaZHJoXZmuunnFopinm5VirrO%2BxKyr</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zonnique-pullins-onlyfans-tiny-harris-reaction-the-mix-interview.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zonnique Pullins Talks OnlyFans &amp;amp; Why She Might Start One Watch Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pokemon-go-raid-schedule-july.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pokmon GO Raids Full Schedule July 2023</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
