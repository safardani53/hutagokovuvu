Cohosts <b>Nev Schulman</b> and <b>Max Joseph</b> met up with Robin from St. Paul, Minnesota, to discover one of the craziest <i>Catfish</i> twists of all time on the Wednesday, July 26, episode of the reality show.</p><p>The episode kicked off with a classic Catfish scenario. Robin hadn’t been able to get her online beau of three years, Wayne, to FaceTime with her and felt frustrated after he insisted on calling her with private phone numbers. Robin even revealed that at one point she sent Wayne $300 to buy a phone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><b>Wayne Stole An Instagram Model’s Photos</b></p><p>After meeting up with Robin and seeing photos of Wayne, Max told her point blank, “He’s not the guy in the pictures. He’s a super handsome guy. You gotta know it’s not him.” Ouch. After some research, Nev and Max discovered they were right — Wayne’s photos actually belonged to a popular Instagram user from Mississippi.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></p><p>When discovering that Wayne was not the handsome man in his photos, Robin appeared crestfallen saying, “He took my life. That’s how I feel.” Eventually Nev and Max were able to get the real Wayne on the phone and asked if the three of them could visit him in Atlanta. He agreed saying, “Y’all can do whatever y’all want.”</p><p><b>Catfish Turns Out to Be Wealthy</b></p><p>Max, Nev and Robin pulled up to an enormously affluent neighborhood in Atlanta. Wayne appeared to live in a mansion with sports cars lined up along his driveway. Nev immediately commented, saying, “He doesn’t look like he needs $300.” Wayne then emerged from his enormous home and explained why he Catfished Robin, saying, “I wanted to know if she was real. … [Women] see the car, they see the house. … She didn’t see all the materialistic stuff. She liked me for me.”</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></p><p><b>Wayne Offers His Maserati to Robin</b></p><p>“This was the only female in my life that was genuine to me,” Wayne said. “I could be myself and that felt good.” He then revealed that he had been married when he started dating Robin but clarified that the relationship ended two years ago. “This is stupid,” Robin balked. The wealthy Catfish then boasted, “You gonna come home or not? … You want the Maserati? … Look at it as a blessing.”</p><p><b>Wayne Admits to Cheating on Robin</b></p><p>Wayne, embarking on an honesty streak, copped to sleeping with other women on top of being married during their online relationship. He then dropped another bombshell. Wayne said, “I’ve never just been solidly committed to one girl. I like to have more than one girlfriend at a time. … We could be one happy family all in one household.” Robin said no. Two months later, Nev and Max checked in with Wayne and he was still single.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><i>Tell Us: What did you think of the latest episode?</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqarJaewKl50Z6amqhdp7yjtc1mqZ6ilZjBtHnWmrCnnV2Ws7Wx0WadoqaUnruoec6uq2asmJp6tb7UrZ9mr2RugXV%2Fj2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stansted-airport-driver-fighting-life-trapped-under-car.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Driver, 63, fighting for his life after getting trapped 'between his car and ticket barrier' at Stan</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./camila-cabello-wearing-bikinis-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Photos Of Her Swimsuits Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
