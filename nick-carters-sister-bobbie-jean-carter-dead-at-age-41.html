She was 41.</p><p>Bobbie Jean, who starred alongside her siblings on the 2006 E! reality show House of Carters, was the sister of Backstreet Boys member <strong><a href=#>Nick Carter</a></strong>. A source exclusively tells Us Weekly that Bobbie Jean’s loved ones believe a cardiac arrest caused her death.</p><p>Her passing comes just over one year after brother <a href=#>Aaron Carter</a> died of an <a href=#>accidental drug overdose</a> at age 34 in November 2022. Prior to Aaron’s passing, sister Leslie Carter died of an accidental drug overdose at age 25 in January 2012.</p><p><strong>Jane Carter</strong>, their mother, announced Bobbie Jean’s death on Saturday. “I am in shock from learning of the sudden death of my daughter, Bobbie Jean; and I will need time to process the terrible reality of this happening for the third time,” Jane said in a statement to <a href=#>TMZ</a>. “When I am able to think clearly, I’ll release a fuller statement; but until then I would request to be left to grieve in private.”</p><p>She added, “[H]owever deeply a parent feels the loss of a child, the suffering of a young child at the loss of a parent must be much greater. So, I would ask the sympathetic to say a prayer for my precious 8-year-old granddaughter Bella, who previously lost her father and is now also left without her mother.”</p><p>In addition to her daughter, Bobbie Jean is also survived by brother Nick, 43, and sister <strong>Angel Carter</strong>, 36. “Nick is having a really hard time processing the whole situation,” the source tells Us.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Nick-Carters-Sister-Bobbie-Jean-Carter-Dead-at-41-13-Months-After-Brother-Aaron-Carters-Death-2.jpg><p>Nick opened up about his brother’s death in August. “It’s definitely been tough for me and my family,” he told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>. “It is still something that we are still processing, to this day. … I don’t think we will ever really get over it. It’s been a lot for us, and we are finding ways to try and take a really tragic situation in our family and do something with it.”</p><p>Angel, who was Aaron’s twin, revealed his <a href=#>final resting place</a> in October. “Aaron’s portrait was placed this morning at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills. He adored his fans, and I know how much this would mean to him now having a final resting place where we could all celebrate his life,” she shared via Instagram on October 13. “I invite you to visit, share your memories, and never forget who Aaron was deep down. 🤍🕊️.”</p><p>In a tribute to Aaron on what would have been his birthday, December 7, Angel shared a tribute and encouraged people to learn more about <a href=#>On Our Sleeves</a>, an organization dedicated to children’s mental health.</p><p>“We grew up under unique circumstances that were surrounded by dysfunction and constant trauma,” Angel wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> alongside childhood headshots of the “I Want Candy” performer. “Sadly, it was a cycle that was repeated amongst generations.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She continued, “Deep in my heart, I feel that Aaron is watching over us. Our efforts, fueled by his inspiration, have already impacted lives and will persist in doing so. You can contribute by dedicating your time to research, fostering education, and cultivating wholesome discussions within your home.”</p><p>Reporting by Andrea Simpson</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGanoZOgeqSt0a2cq6tdqLa0wMSrZJunkpe2pnnJnpinZZOWv7Wx0WabnpmUYq61ecCgnGZsYWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rhea-butcher.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rhea Butcher- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Ethnicity</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./adam-lambert-with-facial-hair-love-it-or-hate-it.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Love It or Hate It?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
