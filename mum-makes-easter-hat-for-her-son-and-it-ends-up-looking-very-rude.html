I was so full of hope. So, so, so foolish</p><p>"'A giraffe!' He declared with a sparkle in his eye. 'Giraffes are my favourite animal mummy!'. I knew that. I half expected him to say giraffe anyway.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000479589855.jpg><p>"My husband tried to put him off the idea - sticking Easter eggs in a nest on top of the hat would be FAR more sensible. Far easier. But his mind was not to be changed. I was not to let my son down."</p><p>After two attempts in the bin, paper mache, super glue and gaffer tape, the mother and son duo managed to come up with something a little less glamorous - and rudely named it after male private parts.</p><p>"My husband laughed, I cried - but my son was incredibly proud of our hard work," she explained. "His favourite part? The giraffes neck. Of course."</p><p>She hoped to make the hat a little less rude after decorating it with felt spots and googly eyes - and despite knowing it's resemblance, sent her son off to school wearing it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000479602874.jpg><p>She added: "Yes, your mother is willing to send you into school with a phallic symbol sticking out of a straw hat because she knew how badly you wanted a giraffe bonnet."</p><p>Thousands of parents saw the funny side, commenting on her post about their admiration for the mum, who was just desperate to fulfil her sons dream.</p><p>One said: "This made me laugh more than it should have done - but Easter bonnets should be whatever the child wants of makes! Your son will proudly remember his giraffe hat and rightly so."</p><p>A woman agreed: "As a primary school teacher I can definitely saw this would have been my favourite! Gave me a laugh for sure."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000479602800-e1553957277604.jpg><p>While another joked: "You can always re-use it for a hen party?"</p><p>A third added: "Is the bonnet for sale? Does it come with batteries?"</p><p>The mummy blogger later added that the suggestive hat went on to WIN the competition at her son's school - telling her followers how 'proud' she was of her creation.</p><p>She wrote: "Giraffe bonnet only went and won the Easter bonnet competition! It just goes to show that if you get a grip of the situation you can pull it off."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in fabulous</h2></p><p>In other parenting news, this brave <a href=#>mum reveals the brutal reality of her post-baby body</a>, including bean bag boobs and a not-so-designer vagina years after birth.</p><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this mum had sex just TWO HOURS after giving birth</a>&nbsp;and jokes it ‘must have been all the drugs I was on’.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5dwbG1uZGV8rsHMZqSao5Woeqat0q2cq2WYlsFuss6rZKGdomLAsLqMmqWdZZmpeqa6w6xkrqhdobywt8innmaulafGbr7UnZxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ryan-gomes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ryan Gomes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./legendary-celebrities-who-have-famous-grandkids.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Legendary Celebrities Who Have Famous Grandkids</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
