To be honest, I probably wouldn’t be alive if it wasn’t for how hard she went with the doctors, with me [and] my stubbornness. She was the perfect helpmate, <a href=#>the perfect matriarch, the perfect mom</a>, the perfect wife in those scenarios.”</p><p class=p1>The comedian first <a href=#>confirmed to <i>Us Weekly</i> in March 2012</a> that he had been diagnosed with an “autoimmune disease, like a lupus type of thing” after <a href=#>previous kidney failure and two blood clots</a> in his lung. “It’s a lot of stuff, but it’s all in order now,” Cannon exclusively told <i>Us </i>at the time. “I feel blessed to be alive.”</p><p class=p3>Cannon was <a href=#>married to Carey, now 54, at the time</a>. He added on the podcast that despite “who she is” as <a href=#>a Grammy-winning pop star</a>, Carey continued to be “loving enough to take on” his health setback.</p><p class=p1>“It probably took a toll on [our relationship] just because of the person I was in my head and the struggles that I was dealing with,” Cannon told podcast host <strong>Steven Bartlett</strong>. “But it definitely brought us closer together.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Nick-Cannon-Praises-Mariah-Careys-Support-After-His-Lupus-Diagnosis.jpg><p class=p1>The <i><a href=#>Masked Singer</a> </i>host, who shares<a href=#> twins Moroccan and Monroe, 12,</a> with Carey, further revealed that he was internally dealing with questions like “Was I was gonna live?” “What was life all about?” “Had I wasted my time?” and if he’d be able to be “here” for his children.</p><p class=p1>“We get caught up in the rat race of the day-to-day, but it slowed down for me on many occasions,” he explained. “Is this a wrap [and is] he almost out of here? And I wasn’t scared, that was the crazy thing when you get to the point where you’re like, ‘Oh, OK, I had a good run.’ … I was content, I wasn’t scared. It happened more than once and it continues to.”</p><p class=p1>Cannon noted that he is frequently reminded of his “physical mortality,” but that being unafraid of death allows “you to focus on living.”</p><p class=p1>Cannon and Carey <a href=#>ultimately split in 2016</a> and the duo have since<a href=#> become amicable coparents</a> for their twins.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“We got our egos and this selfish behavior [but] when you put your children first, you understand that it’s all unconditional love. All that other stuff just falls apart,” Cannon <a href=#>previously told <i>Us </i>in April 2019</a>. “I always want what’s best for my children.”</p><p class=p3><span class=s1>Cannon is also a father of 11 other children. He shares son Golden, daughter Powerful and son Rise with <a href=#><strong>Brittany Bell</strong></a>, as well as twin sons Zillion and Zion and daughter Beautiful with <a href=#><strong>Abby De La Rosa</strong></a>. The <i>Drumline </i>star also coparents son Legendary with <a href=#><strong>Bre Tiesi</strong> </a>and daughter Onyx with <a href=#><strong>LaNisha Cole</strong></a>. Cannon w<a href=#>elcomed his 12th child, daughter Halo,</a> last year with <a href=#><strong>Alyssa Scott</strong></a>. Cannon and Scott’s first child together, <a href=#>son Zen</a>, died in December 2021 at 7 months old.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGanoZOgeqStzaemp2Wgp66qv8SsZKaZop6uqXnCmqmesaNiwLa8z6iprWWUqr%2BqusZmn6KrXaHCscHSZpmarKShsnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./snapchat-is-finally-going-to-let-you-store-all-those-sexy-naked-selfies.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Snapchat Memories will FINALLY let you keep all those sexy naked selfies</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lady-gaga-nude-in-concert.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lady Gaga Nude in Concert</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
