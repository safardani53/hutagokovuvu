Perhaps that is a sign that their jeweler is cutting a few corners."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>The Kardashian fan Instagram account,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kardashian Social</a>, also took their take on the expensive gift, pointing out that Kim had spoiled her son with expensive neckwear in the past.</p><p>Along with the photo the Hulu star shared of Psalm wearing his sparkly present, they posted a throwback video of Kim boasting about an enormous gold chain the youngster previously wore.</p><p>In the clip from an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Kim corrected the talk show host who called her son's sizeable jewelry "fake."</p><p>"He wears this fake, giant chain -" Ellen began to describe the tot's wardrobe before Kim cut her off: "Wait, did you say fake?"</p><p>The Finding Dory star paused in disbelief as Kim giggled at her reaction.</p><p>The pair continued to debate the authenticity of the jewelry as Kim insisted the chain was "not" fake.</p><p>The 64-year-old joked: "Oh my god, it's huge! How can he keep his head up? It looks like a wrestler's belt or something... I just assumed because it was so huge, it's hilarious."</p><p>One follower laughed at the interaction, commenting: "Kim was so offended" with a laughing face emoji.</p><p>A second person gushed over the young boy's lavish gift, writing: "wow what a lucky kid but it looks good."</p><h2 id=hulk-birthday-bash>HULK BIRTHDAY BASH</h2><p>Kim pulled out all the stops for her son's birthday, throwing him an unforgettable superhero-themed bash.</p><p>A wall in the foyer was filled with moving Hulk hands and featured a sign reading: "Psalm Smash."</p><p>Kim filmed her tiny tot riding his brand new mini four-wheeler through the house in a bright purple and green color combo.</p><p>An arts and crafts table was set up with glue, glitter, and other products for the kids to make their souvenirs.</p><p>A specialized mirror had the Hulk's hands smashed through the glass for added effect.</p><p>The reality star's sister&nbsp;<a href=#>Khloe,</a>&nbsp;37, was in attendance as she took to her&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram Stories</a>&nbsp;to document the outlandish affair.</p><p>The TV personality filmed an over-the-top outdoor decor featuring a larger-than-life Hulk statue, tons of balloons, a life-size green city skyline, and a pińata sign with Psalm's name.</p><p>A table was laid out next to the décor where the kids in attendance could create green slime.</p><p>Khloe filmed her daughter True as she mixed green coloring into the slime and stirred the concoction together.</p><h2 id=green-everything>GREEN EVERYTHING</h2><p>The Good American founder then snapped a quick video of Kim's daughter Chicago, four, as she ran around the house wearing a pair of enormous Hulk gloves.</p><p>The little girl lightly punched her aunt in the stomach as the TV star let out a grunt.</p><p>Khloe then panned around a phenomenal green balloon structure, creating a canopy hallway for guests to enter the party space.</p><p>Later, chocolate Hulk hands were arranged on a table for the kids to smash with hammers, revealing a mass of candy inside.</p><p>"What's in there?" the&nbsp;<a href=#>Good American</a>&nbsp;founder asked her daughter&nbsp;<a href=#>True</a>, four, as she pounded the Hulk's hand to create a hole in the top.</p><p>The mother of one then filmed True,&nbsp;<a href=#>Chicago</a>, Kim's oldest daughter&nbsp;<a href=#>North</a>, and Kourtney Kardashian's daughter&nbsp;<a href=#>Penelope</a>&nbsp;as they danced under the green balloon arches.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US

green pinata in the shape of a three.</p><p><a href=#>Kylie</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Kendall</a>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Kourtney</a>&nbsp;were <a href=#>nowhere to be seen</a> in social media videos from
