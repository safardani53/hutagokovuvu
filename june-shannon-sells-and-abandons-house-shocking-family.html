Even without doing that, you at least have a place to sleep.</p><p>Property is how people remain safe and preserve generational wealth. June abandoned that for quick cash — and for Geno.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We then see Doe Doe deliver the news.</p><p>Real talk, we don’t think that this was Lauryn’s first time learning this.</p><p>For one thing, it was reported when June sold her house.</p><p>Just because she didn’t call Lauryn to tell her doesn’t mean that she doesn’t know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>A lot of reality shows feature scenes where the stars pretend to receive information for the first time.</p><p>Rarely is it so obvious as on Family Crisis, where most of the women in the family have the same facial tells when they are acting.</p><p>Eyes wide and mouths slightly open, they just deliver their lines with a little more emphasis.</p><p>It’s not scripted, but it’s planned. Whatever, it doesn’t need to be genuine to be entertaining.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Seriously, Lauryn was giving extra facial reactions the whole time to make sure that editors would have their pick.</p><p>She’s a true professional.</p><p>Anyway, unfortunately they then had to inform Alana.</p><p>We have zero doubt that Alana knew this already before the clearly planned moment when she brought up the idea of one day moving back home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>That said, we’re sure that she was distressed to learn that June had sold the home — Alana’s home.</p><p>Arguably almost as bad, it came out that June had told both daughters that the house would one day by theirs.</p><p>Did she mean that they would share it? Both had seemingly had the impression that they would be the sole heirs.</p><p>Anyway, Alana also brought up her belongings left behind — things that June sold off to any buyer who wanted them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Speaking of June committing crimes, she has a court date.</p><p>Doe Doe declared her intention to be there to confront June when she shows up.</p><p>Sure enough, June and Geno pull up in their SUV, which has seen better days.</p><p>Geno got out of the car, screaming obscenities and homophobic slurs at camera people. There is no excuse for that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>June clearly did not wish to be seen.</p><p>We did not get to see her interaction with Doe Doe, whatever that may have been.</p><p>Hopefully, we’ll see more in the next episode … but we don’t get our hopes up.</p><p>We know that June’s life continued to spiral out of control for months after this was filmed. Now, however, things are looking up.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>June Shannon Flaunts New Tooth: I’m Fixing My Whole Life!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2WDcLbUp5xmq5iWu6%2B7zWaqnqScqHqiusNmmJuZnpm8r7%2BMoaauq5ViwKm7wqSgp59dm66utcuyZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mike-johnson-uses-the-same-creepy-porn-monitoring-software-as-josh-duggar.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mike Johnson and Josh Duggar Use Same Porn-Spying Software</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./6d9b8d5a-b4ad-41e6-ace1-588d6a0e5b47.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Watch CSI: Miami Season 8 Episode 7: Bone Voyage</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
