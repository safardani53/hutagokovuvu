Holiday items</h2><p>As we ring in the new year, Trader Joe’s will be closing up shop on the majority of its holiday items.</p><p>These are products that are specifically here for a limited time for the holiday season, so make sure to stock up on favorites, including:</p><ul><li>Dark chocolate-covered peppermint Joe Joe's</li><li>Mini Hold The Cone peppermint flavor ice cream</li><li>Ginger spread</li><li>Dark chocolate oranges</li><li>Chocolate-covered Lebkuchen cookies</li><li>Egg nog (and the dairy-less oat milk-based O)</li><li>Stroopwafel Dutch caramel waffle cookies</li></ul><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more about Trader Joe's">Read more about Trader Joe's</h2><p>Generally, it’s safe to say Trader Joe’s will be removing any products that have peppermint, gingerbread or egg nog flavors because Americans tend to want these less after the holidays.</p><h2>2. Trader Joe's Medium Roast Decaf Coffee Beans&nbsp;</h2><p>Reports emerged this month that Trader Joe’s would no longer be offering its Medium Roast Decaf Coffee Beans.</p><p>This was sad news to many regular shoppers who relied on the product for their caffeine fix.</p><p>One customer, Joyce Sulahian, took to Facebook to complain.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>“It was the best coffee around that filled the house with coffee aroma when brewed,” Joyce said. “I think TJ's has lost its mind discontinuing all the most popular items.”</p><h2>3. Chocolate Ganache Tort</h2><p>This dessert was a mainstay in many chocolate lovers’ hearts.</p><p>Unfortunately, you won’t see the product back in stores next year because Trader Joe’s permanently removed the item from shelves.</p><p>“A huge loss, especially for us chocoholics,” shopper Jacqui Bradley said on Facebook.</p><h2>4. Turkey corn dog</h2><p>Fans of this hot dog with a twist dish were despaired to learn Trader Joe’s turkey corn dog no longer has a place in stores.</p><p>The item was beloved for its special take on a traditional corn dog, especially for shoppers who had children.</p><h2>5. Organic Tomatillo and Roasted Yellow Chilli Salsa</h2><p>This niche salsa also got the boot at Trader Joe’s this year.</p><p>It went well in South American dishes, and many shoppers were horrified to find it missing.</p><p>Customer Eddie Brock said, “My breakfast burritos will never be the same.”</p><h2>6. Meatless Breakfast Patties</h2><p>Even though Trader Joe’s still offers other meat substitutes, many shoppers were disappointed to find their favorite plant-based offering had been discontinued forever.</p><p>“I miss these soooo much! I can’t find anything anywhere to replace,” wrote Trader Joe’s fan Danielle Luna Carpinelli on Facebook.</p><h2>7. Frozen Fish Korma</h2><p>Another Trader Joe’s entree favorite was the Frozen Fish Korma, but it’s been missing from stores for a while and isn’t likely to return in 2023.</p><p>Trader Joe’s korma entrees are some of their most popular, but it’s likely the fish version didn’t bring enough sales to keep it on aisles.</p><p>As of today, there are still petitions to bring the meal back.</p><h2>8. Orange Blossom Honey French Liquid Soap</h2><p>Many shoppers’ favorite hand soap disappeared from stores this year, and they haven’t been able to find a suitable alternative.</p><p>“My favorite hand soap for over 12 yrs and 2 months later and I’m STILL mad they discontinued it,” Trader Joe’s shopper Brianna Konefall Wells said. “My hands are chapped and cracking as we speak and they NEVER did that with this soap.”</p><h2>Why items get discontinued</h2><p>There are a wide range of reasons why you might see your favorite Trader Joe’s go missing in stores.</p><p>Sometimes it comes down to quality issues.</p><p>If the price of the ingredients surge, it might become too expensive for the retailer to still offer the product.</p><p>However, most of the time, what it comes down to is not enough sales.</p><p>When customers don’t show their appreciation for a product with cold hard cash and repeated sales, it’s safe to say the item won’t stay long on shelves.</p><p>Since Trader Joe’s doesn’t accept fees from manufacturers for their products to appear in stores, they only look at customer sales to decide whether to keep offering a product.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>An employee gave the <a href=#>full details</a> on why your favorite products might be disappearing from stores.</p><p>Plus, a Trader Joe’s superfan outlined the <a href=#>three products</a> you should never buy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfa4ZzgpFsb2isopaxpr6Mo6aeq12ZtrSvzqeroqalmrFutdOepKxn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./elhadj-diallo-3xo4-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Elhadj Diallo (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./atz-kilcher-age-children-net-worth-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Atz Kilcher Age 71 Wiki: Proudest Family Man On TV With Massive Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
