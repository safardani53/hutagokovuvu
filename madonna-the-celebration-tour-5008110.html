From her breakthrough singles in the 1980s like “Holiday,” “Lucky Star,” and “Like A Virgin,” to her reinventions with “Vogue,” “Justify My Love,” and “Take A Bow” in the early 1990s, to the dance-fueled explosion of “Ray Of Light,” “Music,” “Hung Up” and more early 2000s hits, Madonna has remained a relevant music force to this very day. This music icon continues to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>top charts</a> and get people <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>into the groove</a> and&nbsp;will spotlight her legendary career with 2023’s Madonna: The Celebration Tour.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>This career-spanning retrospective will hit 35 cities across the world in 2023 and 2024. The tour was first announced on Jan. 17 with a special video that paid homage to Madonna’s 1991 movie, Madonna: Truth Or Dare. The black-and-white video had Madonna sitting at a table along with stars like <strong>Amy Schumer</strong>, <strong>Diplo, Judd Apatow, Jack Black, Lil Wayne, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bob The Drag Queen</a>, Kate Berlant, Larry Owens, Meg Stalter</strong>, and<strong> Eric Andre. </strong>After a round of dares, including Diplo getting spicy with a margarita and Kate planning a 12-hour date, it’s Amy’s turn. “Madonna, I dare you to do a world tour and play your greatest m*********** hits,” Amy said to the music icon.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“Four decades?” asked Madonna. “As in forty years? As in, all those songs?” Everyone then joined in an acapella singalong to Madonna’s “La Isla Bonita.” When reassured that fans would come to that tour, the Material girl was left with only one response to the dare: “F*** yeah!” “I am excited to explore as many songs as possible, in hopes to give my fans the show they have been waiting for,” said Madonna in the tour’s announcement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/madonnas-the-celebration-tour-ricardo-gomes-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Most recently, Madonna had to postpone the North America shows of the highly-anticipated tour on June 28, 2023, due to her <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hospitalization</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>health scare</a>. Her talent manager, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Guy Oseary</a></strong>, took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> that day to reveal that the 64-year-old had contracted a bacterial infection and was on the road to recovery.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“On Saturday June 24, Madonna developed a serious&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bacterial infection</a> which lead to a several day stay in the ICU,” he wrote in a statement. “Her health is improving, however she is still under medical care. A full recovery is expected.” The tour, as previously mentioned, will be put on pause for the time being. “At this time we will need to pause all commitments, which includes the tour,” Guy added. “We will share more details with you soon as we have them, including a new start date for the tour and for rescheduled shows.” On July 10, Madonna <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>broke her silence</a> about her health incident and confirmed that she was postponing the North American leg of the tour.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>However, just over a month later, Madonna returned to Instagram on August 5 to announce that as she continued to recuperate, the discussions were underway to reschedule all of the dates postponed. “Thank you again for your incredible support and patience over these past few weeks!” Madonna wrote in an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram Story</a>. “I’m happy to report that the re-routed tour schedule will be coming in the next few days! See you soon for a well deserved Celebration!!” Madonna announced the dates for the rescheduled North America shows on August 15.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Days before her opening show in London, a press <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>release</a> confirmed that Madonna would be joined on stage by four of her children.</p><h2>Tickets & Presales</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Tickets went on sale Friday, Jan. 20, and Friday, Jan. 27 at 10 am local time. Fans can go to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>madonna.com/tour</a> for ticket listing.

Those cardmembers will obtained access to presale tickets for shows going “on sale Jan. 20th beginning Tuesday, Jan. 17 at 2 pm local time through Thursday, Jan. 19 at 6 pm local time through the Citi Entertainment program,” the tour announcement stated. “The Citi cardmember presale for the shows going on sale on Jan. 27 will begin Tuesday, Jan. 24 at 10 am local time through Thursday, Jan. 26 at 6 pm local time.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Legacy members of Madonna’s Official Fan Club also had a presale opportunity for the shows that went on sale on Friday, Jan. 20, beginning Tuesday, Jan. 17 at 12pm ET through Wednesday, Jan. 18 at 5 pm ET for the North America based shows and from 9 am GMT/10 am CET to 5 pm GMT/6 pm CET on Wednesday, Jan.18 for UK and European shows.

Fans are encouraged to hold onto their tickets as they will be valid for the new dates once announced,” Live Nation said. The&nbsp;Celebration Tour&nbsp;will kick off in Europe on October 14. Madonna also addressed the rescheduled shows <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in a statement</a> on her Instagram. “My first thought when I woke up in the hospital was my children. My second thought was that I did not want to disappoint anyone who bought tickets for my tour. I also didn’t want to let down the people who worked tirelessly with me over the last few months to create my show. I hate to disappoint anyone,” she wrote. “My current plan is to reschedule the North American leg of the tour and begin in October in Europe.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Madonna officially announced the dates for the rescheduled North America shows on August 15, 2023. LiveNation released a statement saying, “Excitement has been mounting with Madonna’s post that the North America rescheduled dates would be announced shortly. Today, Live Nation is pleased to confirm that most of the North America dates of Madonna’s Celebration Tour have been rescheduled and will take place immediately following the originally announced UK and Europe dates. Tickets for the previously scheduled shows will be honored on the new dates. This includes all dates except Los Angeles and one date in New York due to a venue change.” LiveNation also revealed that several shows in Tulsa, Nashville, San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Phoenix are canceled.</p><h2><span>Openers</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-18>When Madonna first announced The Celebration Tour, she noted that RuPaul’s Drag Race winner and drag performer extraordinaire, Bob The Drag Queen, would be a special guest “across all dates on the global tour.” Expect Bob to bring her trademark stand-up humor to the stage and any additional acts that may be announced before the tour kicks off.</p><h2>Tour Dates</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>The North American leg was postponed and will begin after the European leg.
