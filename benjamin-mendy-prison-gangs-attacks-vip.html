despite prisoners being locked up for the majority of the day during the pandemic.</p><p>The prison is riddled with warring "gangs" who have spent much of their limited out-of-cell time in the last year assaulting each other.</p><p>Mendy's fellow inmates also attack one another with makeshift weapons - including razor blades concealed inside toothbrushes.</p><p>The £52million international footballer was <a href=#>arrested at his home in August</a> following allegations of sexual abuse.</p><p>But the Man City defender was remanded in custody and wasn't<a href=#> allowed to return to his £5million mansion</a>&nbsp;in Cheshire as the multiple rape charges came to light.</p><p>He was transported from court to the Category B prison in August - and is set to stay there until his trial next year after three of his bail pleas were rejected.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>The footballer was put on the VP wing for vulnerable prisoners - <a href=#>but it was reported that he first misunderstood and thought he was going to a "VIP wing."</a></p><p>One prison officer is forced to spend "considerable time" unpicking the tangled web of gangs within the prison walls at Altcourse, The Sun can reveal.</p><p>From July 2020 to June 2021, there were 338 assaults within the prison - and in 35 incidents, a weapon was used by inmates.</p><p>And 53 attacks resulted in police referrals for prosecution, with one prisoner receiving an additional 10 months on their sentence for melting a razor blade into a toothbrush.</p><p>This averages out to 29 assaults per month - which is nearly one attack a day.</p><p>The annual report by the Independent Monitoring Board revealed: "The prison’s local and urban catchment area has led to more conflict which takes place in the community moving inside the walls.</p><p>"To this end one officer spends considerable time trying to unpick the tangled web of Liverpool gangs.</p><p>"During the reporting period the average prison population was 1113 with the number of assaults averaging 29 per month which represents slightly over 2 per cent.</p><p>"Of these, 21 were prisoner on prisoner and 8 on staff."</p><h2>INMATE ATTACKS</h2><p>The report added: "Of the total number of 338 assaults throughout this year, there were 35 incidents of weapon use and 53 police referrals for prosecution."</p><p>And the prison also reported having a substance misuse problem - with the volume of illicit drugs being smuggled into Altcourse staying constant, despite no social visits and limited access to exercise yards.</p><p>But HMP Altcourse also hasn't been drug testing inmates during the pandemic - admitting that the amount of time prisoners spent in their cells may have "hidden" the problem.</p><p>And with an increase in foreign national "high risk" prisoners, the prison's English language education course is now "heavily oversubscribed."</p><p>Despite the attacks between inmates "remaining steady" this year, the report admitted the numbers perhaps weren't higher because "prisoners are locked up for most of the day."</p><p>The France international player has been accused of attacking four women - all over 16 - between October 2020 and August 2021.</p><p>And today he was charged with two more rapes - <a href=#>on top of the four he was already facing.</a></p><p>He is yet to enter pleas to the charges.</p><p>The footballer will appear at Stockport Magistrates' Court on November 17 - and is scheduled to go on trial on January 24, 2022.</p><p>Mendy was arrested after a 17-year-old girl alleged she had been sexually abused at his £5million Cheshire mansion this August.</p><h2>MOB RULE</h2><p>He was also accused of raping a woman last October, as well as a sexual assault in January.</p><p>Mendy was initially charged with four counts of rape and one sexual assault.</p><p>In October, Mendy was denied bail by a judge at a 50-minute hearing at Chester Crown Court. It was the third bail application Mendy had made.</p><p><a href=#>Man City</a>&nbsp;suspended the Premier League left-back in August, pending an investigation.</p><p>In a statement, the club said: “Manchester City can confirm that following his being charged by police today, Benjamin Mendy has been suspended pending an investigation.</p><p>“The matter is subject to a legal process and the club is therefore unable to make further comment until that process is complete.”</p><p>He is now missing from the club's official online shop, with fans unable to buy shirts with his name and number on the back.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>It is not even possible to search for "Mendy" in the search bar, nor can users browse Mendy products under the "shop by player" option.</p><p>He does, however, remain on the squad list with a full bio detailing his career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000694182578.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Man City star Benjamin Mendy leaves court as it's revealed he'll stand trial accused of four counts of rape and one sexual assault</span><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH53g5Rvam1pX5eyr7bApqCnZZ2au6XFjKmpoqufo3qorc2gqmaZpKmupLfSZq2iqF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kordell-stewart-married.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Kordell Stewart Married and Who Has He Been Married To?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bob-kelly.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bob Kelly (baseball)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
