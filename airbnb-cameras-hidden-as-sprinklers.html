In its <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">list of rules for hosts</a>, the service clearly states: "Intentionally concealed recording devices (such as hidden security cameras) are never permitted. Airbnb prohibits security cameras or recording devices that are in or that observe private spaces like bedrooms, bathrooms, or sleeping areas."</p><p>It should be noted that the "private" spaces are considered sacred by Airbnb's rules, and the service goes on to say that if there are any cameras on the property, then <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the host must either include</a> that information in the listing or let guests know that personally.</p><p>However, some users on the platform have noticed that not everyone abides by these rules and only realize that they're possibly being recorded by a concealed camera after they've gotten into their rental.</p><p>This is what Twitter user @foxytaughtyou believed happened to her after she booked a place through Airbnb for her and her friend to stay in during a visit to Philadelphia.</p><p>She posted photos of various sprinklers located in seemingly strange places, until she looked closer and thought there were camera lenses packed in the "holes" of sprinkler housing.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>BE CAUTIOUS BOOKING AIR BNBs!

She added that every time they tried to call the person they wouldn't answer the phone but would only respond via messaging.</p><p>The Twitter user went on to express her disdain with Airbnb, stating that the application didn't give her her money back but just booked them at another location in the area. The Twitter user added that she reported the situation to both Airbnb and the police, but that she wasn't updated on the status of her report.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>AIR BNB COMPANY DID NOT REFUND US!

Your best friend is discerning whether or not these devices pack cameras? A flashlight.

Amazon even carries the product, like this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SPY-MAX</a> branded one that retails for $525. The product's "camera is activated by motion detection" and is said to have "a viewing angle of 80 degrees wide and 70 degrees tall."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Amazon | Spy-MAX</a></figure><p>Some folks, however, were a bit confused as to whether or not the sprinklers were actually cameras, and they began looking at the sprinklers in their own apartments to see whether or not that was the case.</p><p>If you rent an apartment, there's probably a good chance there are sprinklers above you right now you've either forgotten about or never noticed before.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wait, I just checked the sprinkler in my apt.

The City of Philadelphia has clearly delineated guidelines for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sprinkler systems in residential buildings</a>.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quick Response Fire Supply</a> blog states: "Essentially, sprinklers only need to cover rooms of a certain size that are considered living areas. Standard sprinklers cover a 12' x 12' area and extended coverage sprinklers cover a 20' x 20' area, and each head must be placed at least 8' apart; thus, many rooms will only need one or two sprinklers heads."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I'm a sprinkler fitter.

Today, we spoke directly with the lead detective from the Philadelphia Police Department who responded to the complaint and investigated the property."</p><p>Aaron continued, "He confirmed that he did not find any hidden or undisclosed cameras and that the fire sprinklers had regular sprinklerheads.
