She said that Jamie, 55, was “already on his way to recovery.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Months before the health incident, Jamie did an interview with E! News’ Daily Pop in Oct. 2022, and said that his <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>desire to not marry or lead that “cookie cutter”</a> has allowed him to become closer with his kids. “A lot of those marriages ended up not doing well as the kids got older,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jamie</a> said, citing some of his friends’ failed marriages. “Unfortunately, we saw the kids get fractured from their families. Us, we actually came together more. So I don’t know what that is, I just know that it is different but it’s a whole lot of love. The pressure of me being married, I don’t think we’ve even had conversations about it. They just love their daddy, and I just keep moving.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Jamie previously opened up about his parenting secrets during a Dec. 2021 appearance on the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“Dad Confessions”</a> bit from The Ellen Show. Even though his kids clearly love him, he did admit that they keep him grounded when joking about the mean things they say to him. He said that one of their oh-so-loving remarks is, “You’re not as cool as you think you are dad.” Below is everything to know about Jamie’s two daughters!</p><h2>Corinne Foxx</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jamie-Foxx-daughters-Corinne-annalise-ss-post-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Born Feb. 15, 1994 in Los Angeles, California,<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Corinne Foxx</a> (real name <strong>Corinne Marie Bishop</strong>) is Jamie’s firstborn and oldest child. The actor welcomed Corinne with former partner <strong>Connie Kline</strong>, an Air Force veteran. The two had a brief relationship after meeting in 1993.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Corinne has followed in her father’s footsteps with a career in Hollywood, appearing in TV shows and films like 47 Meters Down: Uncaged, Beat Shazam, and Safety. In Sept. 2020, Corinne won an Emmy for outstanding variety special for ABC’s Live in Front of a Studio Audience: All in the Family and Good Times. Jamie immediately took to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to gloat about his daughter’s success. “I would like to introduce to you my daughter, Emmy award-winning Corinne Foxx,” he captioned a celebratory Instagram video, as seen below. “Congratulations on your Emmy award performance! In ‘Good Times For Live In Front Of A Studio Audience’!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Most recently, she appeared in the Hulu series Dollface in 2022. Corrine also serves as a producer on her dad’s Netflix series Dad Stop Embarrassing Me!, which was <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>inspired by her own relationship</a> with her father. “My dad is cool, but he also embarrassed me a lot through my teenagehood,” Corinne told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a> in Dec. 2020. “So we basically wrote a show about it, and I got to cast a girl to play a younger version of myself, which is pretty cool.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/corinne-foxx-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Although Corinne has been embarrassed by her father a time or two, she confirmed in an April 2021 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CBS News</a> that she knows how deeply she is loved by him. “He thinks the world of us, and we can feel it. And that’s really powerful for a young girl to grow up and have such a strong father figure in her life,” Corinne explained. How sweet!</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>On top of acting and producing, Corinne also co-hosts the podcast <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Am I Doing This Right?</a> and runs a lifestyle website called <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Foxxtales</a>. She revealed she thinks it would be a “blessing” to host the Oscars with her dad in a Feb. 2022 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ET Canada.</a> “We know each other’s timing. So I think we’re a good comedic duo,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Corinne made headlines in April 2022, as mentioned above, for announcing her father’s hospitalization to the world. She then revealed he was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>at home recovering</a> from his mystery illness in a May 12, 2023 post.</p><h2>Annalise Bishop</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jamie-Foxx-daughters-Corinne-annalise-ss-post-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>Born on Oct. 3, 2008, Annalise is Jamie’s second and youngest daughter. He welcomed her with his ex-girlfriend, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kristin Grannis</strong></a>. Given both of their private natures, it’s unclear when the duo split, but they were first linked in 2017. As for Annalise, she’s multi-talented, just like her famous father and older sister. Jamie previously revealed that the 14-year-old plays piano, guitar, and football. In a virtual interview with Entertainment Tonight in Aug. 2020, Jamie opened up about the COVID-19 quarantine with his two daughters, revealing that he and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Annalise connected through their shared</a> love of music. “My 11-year-old now knows how to play the piano so well, she actually plays my songs while I sing to them,” he said. “She said, ‘I am going on tour with you.’ I am blessed, we are all blessed.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>And in a n Oct. 2021 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Good Morning America</a>, Jamie gushed about Annalise’s football prowess. “Her last game before COVID, she was playing with the boys, she had 21 points, 17 rebounds, 5 blocks,” he raved. Basically, don’t be surprised if she has a career in the arts or sports someday.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>The proud Girl Dad offered the ultimate piece of advice for all the other Girl Dads out there while chatting with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News’ Daily Pop</a> that same month. “If you start early, Girl Dad, being a new dad, being able to talk about anything under the sun at the age of eight, nine, 10, when they are 18, 19, 20, they’ll say, ‘I can go to my dad and talk about anything,'” the actor explained. “It will pay dividends for the rest of your life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8mapKKdXZu8ucSMnZiun5ipsrO%2FjG1sb2tkaX1w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-sweet-19630704-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Sweet (Metal Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./malia-obamas-dating-history-all-of-her-past-boyfriends-5214227.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>All of Her Past Boyfriends Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
