Whether it's likes on Instagram, a specific type of reacts you're trying to get on Facebook, or retweets on Twitter, we can get extremely concerned with accumulating some type of score to quantify how "successful" we are at internet popularity.&nbsp;</p><p>This is why <a href=#>Snapchat</a> users get very annoyed when their "score" on the app isn't updating.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why is my Snapchat Score not updating?</h2><p>This could happen for several reasons: The first being that you stink and nobody likes you. Just kidding, but it could certainly feel that way. One of the biggest misconceptions about Snapchat Scores is that they update in real time â€” they don't. While some users may experience these updates and see their scores go up or down almost immediately, the general amount of time it takes for them to update is about a week.</p><p>So if you've been eagerly trying to see if your Snapchat Score will go up after you've been snapping with your friends ad nauseam, don't fret â€” take note of your number and wait seven days to see if it goes up. You should see those digits go up after a few days.</p><p>Now what about your friends' Snapchat Scores? Well the same applies to them, however, if you don't see that number go up, then there could be different reasons for that.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>First off, if you don't see a change to a Snapchat user's score after a while, it could be that they're no longer your friend or removed you from Snapchat. Obviously, if you're chatting with them every day and are pretty actively messaging them on the platform, then that isn't the case. However, if you haven't spoken with them in a while, you may want to send them a message and see if you get the dreaded "pending" grey message.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Also, if your friend hasn't officially added you or followed you back and they have a "public" profile, then that could be a reason why you can't see their Snapchat Score or your Snapstreak isn't updating properly with that individual. And while it might seem thirsty and annoying of you to ask them to do so, if seeing their Snapchat Score and flaunting your streak with them matters that much, then maybe you should just message them and see what's what.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Anyone else's snapchat score not updating? It's almost been 48 hours and people still can't see it increase. <a href=#>@snapchatsupport</a> ðŸ¤”</p>â€” Steven (@Steven7SvN) <a href=#>September 25, 2020</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">If your Snapchat Score isn't updating fast enough, then you're not alone.</h2><p>There are tons of other people who think that there might be a "glitch" with their Snapchat account. Another method that's worked for some people has been uninstalling the application entirely off of their Android or iOS device and then re-downloading it and logging back in. Some users have noticed the "stuck score" issue whenever there's an update to the app too, so clearing your app cache could assist with that problem too.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Snapchat score not updating for two weeks even when snap chatting</p>â€” WatchmanOnTheWall (@Life_inLastDays) <a href=#>September 5, 2020</a></figure><p>But again, that cache issue could very well just be resolved if you uninstall and install the app again. In most scenarios, just waiting a week to see the score update should resolve the issue, especially if it takes longer than seven days for your score to jump up in value.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLuivMKhmK1lo5i8s7GMp6atZaWlsaLAyKee</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./valentino-martin.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Valentino Martin Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-momsen-flashes-breasts-in-concert.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Momsen Flashes Breasts in Concert</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
