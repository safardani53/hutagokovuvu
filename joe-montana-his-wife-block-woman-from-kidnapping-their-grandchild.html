The couple <a href=#>attempted to “de-escalate the situation”</a> by confronting the stranger and asking to have their grandchild back. However, a “tussle” subsequently ensued between the NFL legend and the intruder.</p><p>“Mrs. Montana was able to safely pry the child out of the suspect’s arms,” a statement from the sheriff’s office read, per <a href=#>CNN</a>.</p><p>Authorities later identified the attempted kidnapper as <strong>Sodsai Dalzell</strong>. She fled the scene but was later arrested. She is facing kidnapping and burglary charges for the offense.</p><p>Joe issued a statement addressing the matter via <a href=#>Instagram</a> and <a href=#>Twitter</a> on Sunday, September 27. “Thank you to everyone who has reached out,” the retired football star wrote. “Scary situation, but thankful that everybody is doing well. We appreciate respect for our privacy at this time.”</p><p>Joe and Jennifer, 65, <a href=#>have been married since 1985</a>. The longtime couple <a href=#>share four children</a>: Alexandra Whitney, 34, Elizabeth Jean, 33, Nathaniel “Nate” Joseph, 30, and Nicholas “Nick” Alexander, 28.</p><p>It has not been confirmed who the grandchild belongs to.</p><p>In 2015, Jennifer opened up about how family is “everything” to the duo. “I think it’s a question of what’s important,” she told San Francisco-based CBS affiliate <a href=#>KPIX</a> at the time. “You make a list of things you need to do and sometimes it gets squashed… one phone call from the kids [is all it takes].”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Joe, for his part, spoke to <a href=#>Mercury News</a> in 2016 about how he’s enjoyed watching his two sons follow in his footsteps by playing football. “It’s a lot of fun, to a certain degree,” he previously said. “The other part can be heart-wrenching at times. I know exactly what their emotions are, whether they’re up or down, and that makes it tough.”</p><p>The former athlete added, “You hope they never make a mistake, but you also know that can never be the case. There isn’t anyone who can experience that, who can go through it with them, unless you’ve played the position.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5ViurC605qlmmWYnsBuw8ifnGaanKSwrHnWqKSapl2bv7C5jKSgnaaRpb2qusZmq6Gdmad6qL7Ap5ucoJmhsXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./miranda-otto-19671216-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Miranda Otto (Movie Actress) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./self-employment-assistance-program-help-how-much.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is the self-employment assistance program and how much can I get?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
