Aren’t you sick of hearing and reading about me?! LOL Well by now you know that I’m not ‘missing,’ just a little under the weather. I’m sure I will be feeling good and back home in a couple of days.”</p><p>Simmons’ whereabouts have been the talk of Hollywood since he stepped away from the spotlight years ago. The reclusive star shut down his Beverly Hills workout studio last year, and his rep recently slammed the podcast “Missing Richard Simmons” after alleging that Simmons’ housekeeper, Teresa Reveles, was holding him hostage.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Simmons called in to the <i>Today</i> show in March 2016 amid the years-long speculation. “No one is holding me in my house as a hostage. You know, I do what I want to do as I’ve always done, so people should sort of just believe what I have to say because, like, I’m Richard Simmons!” he said. “Right now, I just sort of want to take care of me. I just really don’t want to do anything. I don’t want to be traveling anymore … it’s taken a toll on me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroZOdrrOwjKygpqWfo8BuvsStrKumo2K1sLnEZpifrJWnerW00Z6cZpyRrnqpu9KpoK2ZnGLAta3YZq5tb2hmfXJ7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./u43fnue4ljvke-d9-mnth6qdbdcbphsc.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./langston-hughes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Langston Hughes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
