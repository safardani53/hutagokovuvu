While most children under six months will require hospitalisation.</p><p>About one in 50 babies under one year will&nbsp;suffer seizures,&nbsp;and one in 150 will have encephalopathy (swelling of the brain).</p><p>Catherine, now 36, was shocked to find out her newborn baby had whooping cough.</p><p>"I thought it was a disease of the olden days," the mum-of-two from Perth, Australia, tells Sun Health.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>"I didn't know of anyone who had had it".</p><p>Data from the UK&nbsp;<a href=#>Health</a>&nbsp;Security Agency (UKHSA) revealed 1,141 suspected cases in England and Wales from January to November this year.</p><p>This is compared with 450 for the same period in 2022 and 454 for 2021 – about a 250 per cent increase.</p><p>Experts say it could be a hangover from restrictions during the Covid pandemic when social distancing measures like masks, which meant fewer viruses circulated and immunity dropped.</p><p>Vaccination rates have fallen in the UK since the Covid pandemic.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">latest</a>&nbsp;UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) data on the maternal whooping cough vaccine programme&nbsp;shows that uptake of the jab has dropped to its lowest level in seven years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Blue-eyed boy</h2><p>Riley was born on February 13. 2015, a "healthly and, blue-eyed with soft blonde hair", his mum says.</p><p>Catherine, a charity CEO, first noticed her son was unwell just two weeks after he was born.</p><p>"He started sneezing, his nose was runny, and he had a cough. I thought it was a cold. I wasn't very worried," she recalls.</p><p>A doctor came by the house to check on him and reassured Catherine and Greg, now 38, that Riley was "probably fine" and "lots of <a href=#>respiratory illnesses</a> were going around".</p><p>But over the next few days, Riley stopped waking up to eat, which Catherine says was unlike him.</p><p>"Even when I managed to wake him up to breastfeed, he was so sleepy he would just fall off my breast," she explains.</p><p>It's important for parents to know that babies don't often make that sound. To me, it just sounded like a regular cough.</p><span class=quote-credit>Catherine Hughes</span><span class=quote-credit-meta>Riley's mum</span><p>The parents decided to take their son to the Princess Margaret Hospital in Perth, where he quickly deteriorated.</p><p>"Every day he was there, he just got worse and worse. His coughing got more severe, and his heart rate was high," she says.</p><p>But at no point did Catherine hear the distinctive 'whoop' sound when Riley coughed, which is often associated with the bug.</p><p>"It's important for parents to know that babies don't often make that sound," she says.</p><p>"To me, it just sounded like a regular cough," she adds.</p><p>Doctors hooked Riley up to feeding tubes because he was sleeping all the time, and so could not eat on his own.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fight for life</h2><p>Four days later, doctors diagnosed him with whooping cough, which had developed into pneumonia, a lung infection.</p><p>They decided to put him on life support, including a ventilator which breathed for him, but it was too late; the bacteria had started to "take over his entire body," Catherine says.</p><p>His kidneys, heart, and lungs were failing when doctors took the parents to one side to break the news that Riley would likely not make it.</p><p>"My whole world was crumbling, and my heart was breaking," she says.</p><p>Two days later, the tubes keeping Riley alive were removed from his body, and he was placed in the arms of his mum while Greg crouched down next to them.</p><p>Their daughter, Olivia, 13, who was three at the time, came into the hospital to say goodbye to her baby brother.</p><p>"She gave Riley a quick cuddle and kiss before asking if she could go play. She never really understood the finality of his death until several months later," the mum says.</p><p>Still clinging to hope, Catherine asked the doctor one more time if there was "even the slimmest chance" Riley might make it. But there wasn't.</p><p>"We cuddled, cried, kissed him, and sang to him a lullaby as the life slowly left his body," she recalls.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Heartbreaking goodbye</h2><p>Riley died on March 17, at just 32 days old and ten days before he would have been old enough to get his first whooping cough vaccine.</p><p>In the UK, the whooping cough vaccine is given to babies at&nbsp;eight, 12 and 16 weeks - and since 2012, it has been offered to pregnant women.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Australia, babies are given the jab at six weeks, four months, six months, and 18 months.</p><p>Pregnant women have only been offered the jab since March 19. 2015, two days after Riley died meaning Catherine never got it.</p><p>"If I had been offered a whooping cough booster during pregnancy, there is a good chance Riley would still be with us today," Catherine says.</p><p>Since Riley's death, Catherine has made it her mission to get everyone vaccinated against whooping cough.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>In 2015, Catherine and Greg founded the <a href=# aria-label="Light For Riley project (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Light For Riley project</a>, a campaign to raise awareness of the importance of vaccinations.</p><p>"We can't protect Riley anymore, but we can certainly do whatever we can to protect and save the lives of others," she says.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Whooping cough symptoms</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>WHOOPING cough (pertussis) is a bacterial infection of the lungs and breathing tubes.</p><p>The first signs of whooping cough are similar to a cold, such as a runny nose and sore throat (a high temperature is uncommon).</p><p>After about a week, you or your child:</p><ul><li>will get coughing bouts that last for a few minutes and are worse at night</li><li>may make a "whoop" sound – a gasp for breath between coughs (young babies and some adults may not "whoop")</li><li>may have difficulty breathing after a coughing bout and may turn blue or grey (young infants)</li><li>may bring up a thick mucus, which can make you vomit</li><li>may become very red in the face (more common in adults)</li></ul><p>The cough may last for several weeks or months.</p><p>Source: NHS</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/catherine-hughes-riley-baby-supplied-866472528.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bc1adb41-9db0-4145-9ed4-004f1e61123a.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/catherine-hughes-riley-baby-supplied-866472645.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/catherine-hughes-riley-baby-supplied-866472541.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/45231a30-06f6-4993-8440-42a3c7f5e218.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIZ5g5dua29nkpavunnRoqOesV2ZtqawjLCfqKegnruoecKorKCgXZmuur%2BMm5yfp6KaequtwWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./malia-obamas-dating-history-all-of-her-past-boyfriends-5214227.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>All of Her Past Boyfriends Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./idiot-uses-power-drill-to-eat-corn-on-the-cob-in-record-time.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Idiot Uses Power Drill to Eat Corn on the Cob in Record Time</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp;
