The Italian band, who performed their stunning new song Supermodel at the Video Music Awards (VMAs), was interviewed by iHeartRadio and asked which musicians they wanted to work with.&nbsp;While Mneskin bassist Victoria De Angelis expressed excitement about working with Nicki Minaj, the band’s dynamic vocalist, Damiano David, expressed excitement about working with “the whole BLACKPINK ensemble.” The interviewer, too, couldn’t resist gushing about the intriguing prospect of a collaboration between two such successful bands.</p><p>“I enjoy a double collaboration!”</p><p>Not only that, but Mneskin channeled their inner Blinks when they confessed in an interview with Vanity Fair that the star they wanted to snap a photo with at the VMAs was BLACKPINK.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Maneskin-1.jpg alt=Måneskin width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Fans are overjoyed at the prospect of a BLACKPINK x Mneskin collaboration.</h2><p>BLINKs couldn’t control their enthusiasm over Damiano David’s wish to collaborate with their favorite group and have been gushing about how much fun the tunes would be. Their excitement was also fueled by the prospect of Rosé channeling her inner rock star as a result of this cooperation. Fans have been unable to get over Rosé’s punk-rock avatar, where she captivated everyone’s attention with her edgy attire and electric guitar style, since the release of Pink Venom.&nbsp;Not only that, but fans have long advocated for Rosé to record a pop-rock song because they believe her distinct voice would be a fantastic match for the genre.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>blackpink & maneskin collab would EAT <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/ANd2JSUBXT</a></p><p>— alejandro (@taylorsversion) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">August 29, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Imagine maneskin collab with BP, rosé unleashed her inner rockstar to the fullest with guitar, jisoo singing with her deep voice and jenlisa subtle rap</p><p>— roza (@rozalinakarim_) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">August 30, 2022</a></p><h2>BLACKPINK takes the show at the VMAs</h2><p>BLACKPINK stole the scene at the VMAs, despite the fact that it was their first performance at the renowned award event.&nbsp;As different celebs exposed themselves to be huge BLACKPINK fans, their fame skyrocketed.
