In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue</a>, Michaela revealed that Aneka’s sexuality was a major reason why she took on the role.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“That sold me on the role, the fact that my character’s queer,” the actress said. “I thought: I like that, I want to show that to Ghana. [Black Panther] is about representation on a very mainstream platform, about the magic of Africa, the magic of the people, our ancestors.” Michaela also told&nbsp;Vogue&nbsp;how she bonded with the cast who were mourning Chadwick’s death. “There was a sense that we have to bring this baby home in the name of Chadwick. I thought to myself, I’m rolling up my sleeves and I’m getting in. I don’t need to be front and center, I’m here to support,” Michaela said.</p><h2>Her career started in theater.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Michaela started her career as an actress and poet, which launched her into the theater world. Her play Chewing Gum Dreams&nbsp;was produced by the&nbsp;Bush Theatre and the Royal National Theatre in England from 2013 to 2014. Michaela starred in the play which told a dramatic story about a 14-year-old girl.</p><h2>She won an Emmy for ‘I May Destroy You’.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>At the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2021 Emmy Awards</a>, Michaela won Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series for her work on the HBO miniseries&nbsp;I May Destroy You.

In total, Michaela received four Emmy nominations for&nbsp;I May Destroy You, including Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series, where she lost to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kate Winslet</strong></a> for <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mare of Easttown</a>.</p><h2>She is British.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Michaela was born in East London, to Ghanaian immigrant parents. Her parents separated when she was young so she was raised by her mother. She attended Catholic schools in East London, before studying at the University of Birmingham. She transferred to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, where she fell in love with acting.</p><h2>She identifies as ‘aromantic’.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Michaela’s confirmed she identifies as aromantic, which is when&nbsp;someone has no interest in romantic relationships. “I googled aromanticism and I very much felt like, ‘Oh, that’s me,’ ” Michaela said in an<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> interview.</a> “I am OK being by myself,” she also said. “I like having intimate relationships but I don’t want to change people or want to be changed by anyone. Diamond rings don’t make me happy. Flowers don’t make me smile. I can’t smell them. I don’t have a sense of smell. I want to know who you are.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K6qq%2FHmpylmV2YvKa4jG1vcmxpZX5w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dwts-val-chmerkovskiy-tries-not-to-be-a-dick-to-gabby-windey.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>DWTS' Val Chmerkovskiy Tries Not to Be a 'Dick' to Gabby Windey</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ross-mcgowan.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ross McGowan</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
