2023.</p><p>It was bought from a Speedway gas station at 1086 West Broadway Avenue in Forest Lake.</p><p>The numbers to look for in this case are 8, 11, 27, 30, and 37.</p><p>Minnesota's lottery office confirmed the prize money will expire one year from its drawing date.</p><p>That means players have until April of 2024 to find their ticket, and their claim, to victory.</p><p>"To confirm that a ticket is a winner, please have the ticket validated through a sales terminal at any Minnesota Lottery retailer," as per mnlottery.com.</p><p>Only cash prizes up to at least $25,000 are listed on the website.</p><p>According to official <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">game rules</a>, the prizes awarded as grand prizes, which match a player's first five numbers they pick, "are determined by a Pari-mutuel basis starting at $100,000 in the Grand Prize pool, with a minimum of $100,000 paid in a single ticket."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>To claim prizes over $50,000, players must go to the Minnesota Lottery’s headquarters in Roseville.</p><p>Appointments are recommended, and its hours are Monday through Friday from 8 am to 4 pm.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>GOPHER 5 RULES</h2><p>The Gopher 5 game started back in 1991.</p><p>According to mnlottery.com, it's exclusive to Minnesota's lottery, as, "Some of the best things are only available in Minnesota."</p><p>Players choose five of their favorite digits between one and 47 or use Quick Pick for the lottery computer to generate them randomly.</p><p>Note that the jackpot paid is "paid in cash and gets "divided equally among all winning tickets if there is more than one winner."</p><p>The minimum jackpot amount of money for each drawing is $100,000.</p><p>Tickets are sold for a dollar, and winning numbers are drawn every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.</p><p>Matching all five numbers scores the jackpot trophy, but there's a couple different combinations for winning more modest prizes.</p><p>Matching four numbers results in a $500 prize, while three amounts to $15, and two — $1, to earn the original ticket fare back.</p><p>Players have a one in 13 chance of matching two numbers.</p><p>The odds of matching all five of them to snag the jackpot is one in 5,333,939.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>MORE TO SCORE</h2><p>Minnesotans can enter another <a href=#>US lottery</a> game specific to their state: North 5 — the five digits are picked between one and 31.</p><p>There's
