John Teti said,</p><p>“Tessitore is a merchant of schmaltz…Cliches are a given in football announcing, but few commentators imbue NFL banalities with the portentous sentimentality that Tessitore brings to bear.”</p><p>Nonetheless, the years of working in broadcasting media have helped him make his style.
