I came out of my mother’s vagina in Bay City, Michigan, but I was born in New York City!” she went on.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“In case you didn’t know, the reason that New York is so great is that I’m pretty sure that the first queer human evolved from this city. I think they came from the caves of Central Park West,” she explained. “I’ve heard this conspiracy theory, that I don’t believe is a conspiracy theory. Anyways, not only is New York City the best place in the world because of the queer people here. Let me tell you something, if you can make it here, then you must be queer. Did you hear what I said?” she said to the audience, which included celebs like <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pal <strong>Julia Fox</strong></a>, <strong>Zachary Quinto</strong>, <strong>Jonathan Groff</strong>, and<strong> Billy Eichner</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5FuZqaZlKS7r62MrKanZZSWw6qwjJuYp5yRYr2ztcOeZKmdopu8s7nAp5qeZaaesaa7jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./newmarket-racecard-results-and-tv-schedule-todays-tips-runners-results-and-stats-for-the-meeting-live-on-racing-uk-this-thursday-may-17.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Newmarket racecard, results and TV schedule: Todays tips, runners, results and stats for the meet</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-pauly-d-still-dating-nikki-hall-relationship-career-explore.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Pauly D Still Dating Nikki Hall?
