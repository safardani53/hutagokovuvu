Safe, sane, consensual is the goal y'all.</p><p>"My body, my life, my income, my choice. I owe not a single person my autonomy or virtue just because of a name."</p><p>Now in her first interview, Mikaela, who lives in Nashville, Tennessee, told how she hopes her new career choice will help her become financially independent from her Hollywood parents.</p><p>"I've always been a very sexually natured person, which has gotten me in trouble before. Not in a predatory way, but just in the sense that people here in the South might not yet be comfortable with that," she said.</p><p>"My main hope is just that I get somewhere lucrative enough to where I'm not tied down financially by things. And then I can really start saying to people there's nothing wrong with me using my body in a way that feels comfortable to support myself.</p><p>"I can't stay dependent on my parents or even the state for that matter - not that there's anything wrong with that - it just doesn't feel comfortable for me.</p><p>"This isn't like an 'end of the road' or 'I've hit bottom' choice.</p><p>"This is a positive, empowering choice, I realized there is no shame in having a fascination with this industry and wanting to do something that is safe, sane, consensual."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/Mikaela_Spielberg_012JPG-JS562877073.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/Capture7JPG-JS563022284.jpg><p>Mikaela told how it had been a huge confidence booster to show off her large natural breasts, which she describes as her "moneymaker" - and how she plans on producing more solo erotic videos to show off her curves.</p><p>And while she said she'd be happy at turning her hand to fetish videos - she draws the line at having sex with another person on camera, out of respect for her supportive fiancé Chuck Pankow, 47.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/Chuck-Pankow-mikael-spielberg-03.jpg><p>"I think I would be great at fetish work," she laughed.</p><p>"Honestly I have hated my chest for so long but I've finally learned to embrace it. That was one of the things when I uploaded these first couple of videos, I realized, 'This is the moneymaker' - my large chest.</p><p>"And it was actually really nice and refreshing to have people saying cool things - because people can often say really upsetting things about a black woman's body sometimes.</p><p>"And the reason I don't want to do anything outside of solo stuff is because I feel like it would be a violation of my boundaries and my relationship with my significant other."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/Mikaela_Spielberg_008JPG-JS562877092.jpg><p>The ET and Jaws director's daughter has chosen the stage name Sugar Star for her adult entertainment career.</p><p>She posted a series of raunchy self produced videos on PornHub - however she decided to take the videos down temporarily - until her application for a Tennessee sex worker license is approved.</p><p>While making self produced porn videos is not illegal - Mikaela was adamant that she was keen to keep everything "legitimate and above board".</p><p>The first clips she made included one sensual video titled, "Huge breasted woman pleasures herself in calm environment".</p><p>Another video was called, "I give my huge natural breasts some love and care with rose tea oil."</p><p>Mikaela, a talented artist, has already attracted a fan base - which she describes as "mainly older white men".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/GettyImages-103492041jpg-JS562960408.jpg><p>The 23-year-old says she has huge love and respect for her parents and admits that while she was nervous about telling them, she wasn't surprised that they were supportive.</p><p>She said: “My safety has always been a number one priority for them.</p><p>"I'm doing this, not out of an urge to hurt anybody or be spiteful about it, I'm doing this because I want to honor my body in a way that's lucrative.</p><p>"I actually think that once they see how far I've come from the bottom I was at a year and a half ago, they're going to look at this and go, 'Wow, we actually raised are really self-assured, young lady."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/Mikaela_Spielberg_013JPG-JS562877067.jpg><p>While Mikaela is now excited and positive about the future and her new career, she also spoke out - for the first time - about her difficult past in which she says she suffered sexual abuse.</p><p>She says she was groomed and abused by "predators" growing up - although she is keen to point out these men were outsiders and not anyone from her family or their circle of friends.</p><p>She says that contributed to her suffering years of mental health issues including anorexia, borderline personality disorder and alcoholism.</p><p>"I'm very open about my borderline personality disorder both publicly, with friends and online - because we're portrayed as manipulative monsters a lot," Mikaela said.</p><p>"You have movies like Gone Girl, which kind of portray us as cold, unfeeling, 'in-it-for-the money' monsters."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/GettyImages-91457109jpg-JS562960489.jpg><p>Mikaela says her childhood problems were exacerbated when she was sent to a boarding school for troubled teens - which instead of improving her problems and behavior - actually had the opposite effect.</p><p>"I came out of there worst than I was going in - with more anxiety and more attachment issues, more depression and more hatred from my body. I actually developed an eating disorder while I was living there," she said.</p><p>"It's not my parents' fault. They couldn't have known."</p><p>Mikaela eventually turned to drinking to cope with her childhood trauma - and admits that some days she drank so much she almost died.</p><p>"I was really out of control from about the age of 11 years old, even to up up to two years ago," she said.</p><p>"So that out of control-ness only stopped pretty recently. When I was 21, I used to drink every day and that went on for like two years until I almost died a couple of times."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/NINTCHDBPICT000563085661.jpg><p>Thankfully after working through her issues with therapists and with the support of loyal fiance Chuck she says she is in a positive place.</p><p>Mikaela added: "I'm in a good place right now, but we all have relapses. Being open in this way and sharing my story and choosing this career is not a relapse for me. I actually feel very grounded and validated right now."</p><p>She admitted that boyfriend Chuck took a while to accept her sex industry ambitions - but now is fully supportive of her choices.</p><p>"It took him a long time to come around to it because obviously in the South there's so much shame around that still,” Mikaela said.</p><p>"We still have this idea of what women can and cannot be - this is such a de-legitimized form of work. Even though it's legal to be an adult actor and make and write erotica privately, you you can't do it publicly without a license in Tennessee...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/GettyImages-103492041jpg-JS562955229.jpg><p>“Chuck’s been super supportive, but it took him a while to get to that spot because he wasn't sure how his social group would react to it.</p><p>"And thus far, it hasn't been the best, but that was expected because of the environment we live in right now."</p><p>She also says she's prepared for a backlash by people who may disagree with her entering the adult profession - given her privileged Hollywood background and famous father’s movie legacy.</p><p>"People will be resentful about this, people will be angry because it's like almost like I'm taking a piece of their security away by being independent," she said.</p><p>"People sometimes can feel pretty entitled to your body, to your respect, to your time.</p><p>"So I have 50% of the people going, 'Let me see your boobs!' and then 50% of the people going, 'How dare you ruin this last name for us?'"</p><p>Mikaela was adopted at birth by Spielberg and his wife in 1996. The Hollywood power&nbsp;couple are also parents to Jessica Capshaw, Max Samuel Spielberg, Theo Spielberg, Sasha Rebecca Spielberg and Sawyer Avery Spielberg and Destry Allyn Spielberg.</p><p>Mikaela revealed how she had a privileged childhood where A listers would be in and out of their mansion in Pacific Palisades, a home she describes as a “work of art”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/Mikaela_Spielberg_004JPG-JS562877070.jpg><p>She would also attend events such as the Oscars with her father - although protective Spielberg always shielded his kids from doing red carpets.</p><p>And Mikaela remembers visiting movie sets and sitting in editing rooms with her dad, as the director’s cult classic films were being created.</p><p>“I was on the set of Artificial Intelligence at a really young age and I remember the lighting being so beautiful yet eerie," Mikaela recalls.</p><p>She adds: "My lifestyle growing up; I was spoiled, but responsibly - and my parents raised me with the value of hard work and an understanding of human dignity and how poverty impacts the outside world.</p><p>“I was bullied viciously in school because of my last name and my weight but we had some amazing caretakers growing up who always helped us manage our emotions in times of stress."</p><p>Mikaela admitted that growing up in one of Hollywood's most famous families was "difficult" and admits they have had their ups and downs caused by the pressures of fame and money - as well as her emotional issues.</p><p>However she and dad Steven had a very close relationship growing up and she said she has fond memories of playing computer games with him - and gained a love of sci-fi and horror from him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/GettyImages-463746709jpg-JS562955249.jpg><p>"He always loved that I was super unique and he's literally like an angel. He's always loved that I know exactly what I want," she said fondly.</p><p>"And you know, we've had our conflicts, but he always has loved the way my brain functions and he really nurtured that for me.</p><p>"Growing up, we would sit together at his computer and play first-person shooter games or have these long, drawn-out dorky conversations about things.</p><p>"In fact, one of my first and favorite books he purchased for me is a huge compilation of HP Lovecraft stories because I was 10 years old and I was asking questions about it and he said, 'Oh, I'll buy you the book'.</p><p>"And he just loves to nurture my creativity and my identity in a way that I find really life affirming.</p><p>"Growing up, I can only say I'm into sci-fi and fantasy because of him. Some of my best moments growing up were engaging in those kinds of hobbies.</p><p>"I honestly I think if he weren't the man he is right now, he would probably be somewhere painting little models for tabletop games. That would be like his thing if he wasn't a famous director, he’s very nerdy. I love him so much."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in news</h2></p><p>And despite everything, Mikaela says she now she enjoys a good relationship with both parents and her siblings - and hopes her career decisions don't cause any upset.</p><p>"I have amazing parents that had their struggles with me, I've had my fights and struggles with them, but it's only out of fear that people sometimes care incorrectly because they want you to be alive and safe," she said.</p><p>"They are some of the least spiteful people I know. I love them so deeply.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsYGp%2Fc4KOrKuerpWjerS8yJ6jm52inHqlrdSgn62domK6qrfAnqOaZaCkv6950q2Yq2WVp7y1tcJmm5qmk5q%2FcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-std-does-elijah-pritchett-have-was-he-arrested-for-transmitting-herpes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What STD Does Elijah Pritchett Have?
