However, due to some unknown circumstances, they have to endure one of the baby’s losses.</p><p>But Gabby did give birth to one of the twins, on <strong>June 24, 2017</strong>, and named him Jaxson Lynn Woodland. Gary shared the news with his fans via Instagram, just like every other time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Gary-welcoming-Jaxon-Lynn.png><p>During a 2017 interview with <strong>Golf Channel</strong>, Gary spoke about the difficulty and challenges. He said,</p><p>“Every off week since the Match Play my wife or my kid has been in the hospital.</p><p>The only week he wasn’t in the hospital we had to evacuate Florida, so it’s juts been no off weeks and that’s been tough.”</p><p>Added to this, he also admitted how difficult it was to play his best.</p><p>“The first couple of months after everything happened it was tough for me, mentally. It was tough because I was playing so well leading up to that.</p><p>I gave myself so many chances early in the year to win and just dealing mentally off the course, I couldn’t focus enough.”</p><p>Maybe it’s because Jaxson is their first child who came with the world amidst all the trouble, but the couple deeply loves their son.</p><p>Hence, after winning the 2018 Waste Management Phoenix Open, the golfer shared the moment with his wife and son.</p><p>“That was just kind of a tribute to last year.

Talking about him, Gary was born on May 21, 1984, in Topeka, Kansas, US.</p><p>Likewise, the 39&nbsp;years old is a professional golfer who plays on the PGA Tour. He has competed in the tournament since 2009 and has grabbed four wins.</p><p><strong>Aside from that Woodland is also known as one of the longest hitters on tour.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Gary-Woodland-Source-Pinterest.webp><p>As for recent achievements, Gary won the US Open in 2019, his first major championship and overall sixth professional victory.</p><p>To celebrate his win, Gary’s parents were behind the 18th green there with him while his wife and young son were back home in Delray Beach, Florida.</p><p>Moreover, his win at the US Open improved his position from 25th to 12th in the<strong> Official World Gold Ranking.</strong></p><p>Two days later, after face-timing life, Gary finally joined <strong>Bockerstette</strong> with a surprise appearance on <strong>‘The Today Show.’</strong></p><p>There he pointed at the US Open trophy in Bockerstette’s hands and told her,<strong> “We won this together.”&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>Gary Played College Basketball Before Being A Golfer.</h3><p>Born to Dan and Linda Woodland, Gary excelled as a basketball player in his early years. So much so that after high school, he straight went to Washburn University in Topeka on a basketball scholarship.</p><p>Even his high school coach, Craig Cox described his game in an interview with ESPN.</p><p>“There is no range limit. As a coach, you’re looking at guys, that, as they get further from the basket, they have to change their shot.</p><p>But he was so strong in his forearms and his wrists, which I think is contributing to his golf power. His shot looked exactly the same from 1.5 m to 10.6 m. I never said a word.”</p><p>However, even having a bright future in basketball, Gary left Washburn after his freshman year and attended the <strong>University of Kansas</strong> in Lawrence on a golf scholarship.</p><p>Just like his basketball career, Woodland was impressive in gold as well. Before he turned professional in 2017, Woodland had four tournament wins under his name.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gabby-004.jpg><p>But this has not changed things, and Gary is still friends with Bill Self<strong>,</strong> the Kansas basketball coach, and his passion for basketball.</p><p>In his interview with <strong>Yahoo Sports</strong>, Bill takes fondly of Gary,</p><p>“I watch every shot and every tournament I can. I don’t want to miss out on anything.</p><p>Gary was a basketball player at Washburn when we played them, actually. I tell him he didn’t even make our scout report.”</p><p><strong>Learn about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Karen Jarrett ex-wife of Kurt Angle, Age, Height, WWE, Husband, Net Worth >></a></strong></p><h2>How Old Is Gabby Granado?</h2><p>Dazzling and gorgeous to boot, Gabby indeed has kept her mouth shut when it comes to her family, but she cannot block the cameras.
