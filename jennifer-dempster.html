Yet, even at this age, Dempster looks fresh and flawless.</p><p>Her brunette hair, beautiful face, and curvy body caught much attention of netizens.</p><h2>Jennifer Dempster: Career</h2><h3>Career as an Actress</h3><p>Jennifer Dempster started her acting career when she was only 10. She played the character, Clara, in the movie named Nutcracker.</p><p>Her charming beauty and innocent girl-next-door look caught the attention of both male and female audiences.</p><p>Some of her movies are The Waterboy (1998), Marci X (2003) alongside TV show FRIENDS’ star Lisa Kudrow, It’s About Time(2005), Runaway(2005) & The Chew(2011).</p><h3>Career as a Fitness Model</h3><p>Jenifer was known to the public more for being a fitness model. She gained popularity from ESPN’s College Football (1979) & Wimbledon Championship.</p><p>The show which was a turning point for Jenifer in her career was ESPN’s “Body Shaping.” This show was aired between 1990-1998 and was one of the hit shows of that time.</p><p>An exercise and fitness show included cardiovascular exercise, weight training, nutrition, and stretching sections.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fitnessmodel-jennifer-dempster.jpg><p>Notably, she was on the stretching and aerobic segments of the show.

It was from the party their love blossomed, and the couple started dating.</p><p>Nearly after dating for fifteen years, Chris proposed in one of the most romantic ways.</p><p>He and Jennifer went to Paris to meet one of their friends, and one morning when they were on the hotel balcony sipping coffee, Chris proposed to her.</p><p>It’s most of the girl’s dream to get a marriage proposal in the city of Paris. So Chris asked Jennifer to live with him forever, and of course, Dempster said YES.</p><h3>Marriage Ceremony</h3><p>The couple had a fairy-tale-themed wedding at Oheka Castle in 2006. Jennifer’s friend jokingly used to call them the “Green Acres” couple. The reason behind this unique nickname is because of Jennifer’s and Chris’s background.</p><p>Chis Flower is from the Colorado mountains, while Jennifer is from New York City, so choosing the wedding venue was tricky.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wedding-day.jpg><p>The reason behind choosing Oheka Castle as their venue for marriage is also enjoyable. This place was Jeni’s favorite place while growing up.</p><p>She once revealed,</p><p>” As a little girl, I could see the top of the castle from my school bus stop. And when we called the castle to inquire about weddings, the phone number was very familiar. It was the old number from the house I grew up in. It was kismet.”</p><p>Finally, Jennifer and Chris exchanged vows in front of close friends and family in the beautiful garden of Oheka.</p><p><strong><a href=#>Darius Slay Net Wort & Lifestyle >></a></strong></p><h3>Disaster in Wedding</h3><p>Even though all the preparation was perfect but Jennifer did encounter some troubles in her wedding.</p><p>Just weeks ahead of her wedding, she unknowingly put sunblock with a tan accelerator on her upper lip, which left the mark of a mustache. It must have been a horrible experience for any soon-to-be bride.</p><p>Not only this, but on her final fitting, accidentally she cut her finger with a seamstress and bled all over the front of her dress! Which, later, was thankfully cleaned.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wedding-picture.jpg><p>Also, terrible thunderstorms occurred near their wedding day; they canceled flights and lost luggage with groomsmen’s tuxes.</p><p>On her wedding day, she smashed her car window against the side mirror of the florist’s van. It was definitely a lot of chaos, but in the end, they did get married and lived happily till this till.</p><p>They planned their honeymoon at some of the exotic places like Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa.</p><p>However, Jeni and Chris were together for nearly 16 years before marriage and had been on vacation several times.&nbsp;</p><h3>Children</h3><p>The couple is highly secretive about their personal lives. They never share anything about themselves online. So, regarding information about their kids is quite a tricky topic.</p><p>But, it is said that they still don’t have any kids.
