The show revealed that he was the newest participant looking for love. This time, he’ll be confronting his past in an attempt to reclaim his former Gemma Owens.</p><p>The popular reality series, which started on ITV 2 on Monday, June 6, 2022 at 9 p.m., saw 11 islanders enter the villa and remain in the hopes of finding the love of their life. Initially, the competitors would be matched with various islanders to assist them in finding romance, and any who remained single after the pairing would be dismissed from the program.</p><h2>Jacques O’Neill will be on the program to reunite with his ex-girlfriend.</h2><p>The 23-year-old competitor is a Cumbrian professional rugby player. He dated former Liverpool striker Michael Owens’ daughter Gemma Owens, who is now a Love Island UK 2022 competitor. Viewers heard Gemma mention in the previous episode’s teaser:</p><p>“Oh no, it’s my ex-boyfriend!”</p><p>Jacques and Gemma divorced last year, although they apparently parted on good terms. The latter revealed to fellow competitor Liam Llewellyn (who left the island last week) that his ex-boyfriend and her England ace father were close and bonded over their similar love of the sport.&nbsp;According to a source, the former pair still had “unfinished business” and had emotions for each other, which may make it difficult for them to stay in the villa together and simply be friends.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jacques-ONeill-2.jpg alt="Jacques O’Neill" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The source continued, saying:</p><p>“They split up because they were both preoccupied with their work.” Gemma was often gone for dressage contests, while Jacques was focused on his rugby career. But there is no ill will between them. It was simply not the proper moment.”</p><p>When questioned on the television network about why he was unmarried and why he was on Love Island UK, Jacques replied:</p><p>“I breakup with my ex and began seeing someone else. I was focusing so hard on my rugby career until I got injured. I believe it must be the right person at the right moment. But I was just telling my mother the other day that I want a daughter. And now I’m prepared to settle down.”</p><h2>Jacques O’Neill Career</h2><p>Jacques began his career with Askam ARLFC before joining the Castleford Tigers program. The candidate has also played on loan and dual registration for Leigh Centurions and Halifax in the Betfred Championship.&nbsp;The Castleford Tigers issued a statement on social media and in a press release shortly before the Love Island UK participant announced his debut on the show:</p><p>“The Castleford Tigers can announce that the Club has decided to release Jacques O’Neill from his contract in order for him to explore other opportunities.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jacques-ONeill-3.jpg alt="Jacques O’Neill" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Fans will see Jacques enter the villa, much to the astonishment of Gemma, who was taken from Davide Sanclimenti by Luca Bish during the recoupling on Friday. However, the rugby player told viewers that he would not allow the competition to prevent him from achieving his dreams.&nbsp;The Love Island UK candidate said that he “wasn’t arsed” about treading on anyone’s toes and that he would do whatever he pleased. According to Jacques:</p><p>“I believe I’m a keeper.” Don’t we all believe we’re attractive? I’m dependable, considerate, and courteous. I’ll care after someone dear to me to the best of my ability.”</p><p>Jacques also mentioned hoping to be a parent in a few years. He said:</p><p>“I’d have a child in two or three years.” I suppose I’d be wonderful with kids as well; they’d be cute, wouldn’t they?”</p><p>Love Island UK will be shot in Majorca Villa in Spain, with candidates having no contact with the outside world. They will use their time to locate the right mate, with the possibility of removal if they remain single after the re-coupling challenges. The victorious pair will get a £50,000 grand prize.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsButsCcqK6do2K8r7HIpaNmnqKkum64zq%2BcZqGjoa6vsIyuomg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-rafael-devers-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Rafael Devers Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./burkl-ydbyzojamnhtalbw8yodbtw2xf.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Watch Rugrats Season 8 Episode 8: Bad Shoes/The World According to Dil &amp;amp; Spike/Falling Star</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
