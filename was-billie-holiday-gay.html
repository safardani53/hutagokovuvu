Her personal life was equally as significant as her public one.</h2><p>Billie lived a ridiculously tumultuous existence, something that can be heard in many examples of her music. The "Strange Fruit" singer faced a bevy of personal tragedies, which culminated in a well-known addiction to drugs.</p><p>The compounding effects of a harsh life saw Billie incarcerated for a brief stint, and according to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Illinois</a>, the jazz musician engaged in multiple lesbian relationships while in prison.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Throughout the rest of her career, Billie was openly a bisexual woman, and actually had an array of high-profile relationships with other famous figures in Hollywood and beyond at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who were Billie Holiday's partners?

Although she did marry men in the past, Billie's interactions with women are why she is heralded as a modern icon amongst openly LGBTQ musicians. The singer dated the likes of Louise Crane, who was a prominent American philanthropist and socialite at the time. After that, she most notably dated American actress Tallulah Bankhead, a figurehead of film.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why was Billie's voice so unique among her entire genre?</h2><p>Billie's now-infamous unique cadence is something that was forged through years of abuse and profound personal turmoil.
