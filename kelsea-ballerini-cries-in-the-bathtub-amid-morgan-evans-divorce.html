We won’t be together / But maybe the next life,” the 19-year-old Scottish artist sang in her debut single. “I’m being a cool girl&nbsp;/&nbsp;I’m keeping it so tight. I carry him home while my friends have a good night. I need him like water, he thinks that I’m alright.”</p><p class=p1>She added in the track: “I’m not feeling human / I think he’s a good guy.”</p><p class=p1>The Tennessee native, for her part, <a href=#>sat naked in the bathtub</a> while listening to the lyrics.
