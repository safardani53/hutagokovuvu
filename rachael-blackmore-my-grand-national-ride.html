I have never ridden him before, but he is a very nice ride to pick up for Gordon and Gigginstown.</p><p>He has to bounce back from his run in the Martin Pipe Hurdle at Cheltenham, when he was sent off as joint favourite, but hopefully he can, because his form from earlier in the season is good.</p><p>He won his maiden and a listed race, and he probably put up his best performance in finishing a close fourth behind Good Land in the Grade 1 two-mile-six-furlong hurdle at the Dublin Racing Festival in February.</p><p>This is a very competitive race, but hopefully he can go well.</p><p><strong>5.15 – Ain’t That A Shame</strong></p><p>I love the Grand National. It’s a class race, and all that goes with it. All the history.</p><p>And it’s a great feeling, getting ready for the race again, knowing that I was lucky enough to win it before.</p><p>Nobody expects to win the Grand National. You go there hoping, but you need so many things to fall your way.</p><p>You only get one shot at most at winning it every year, if you are lucky enough to even get one shot at it, and even when you do, you usually have just one chance in 40 of winning it.</p><p>There’s such a buzz in the weigh room, so much anticipation. And when you go out to ride in it, nobody is putting pressure on you. Go out and enjoy yourself. The best of luck.</p><p>Ain’t That A Shame has a lovely profile for the race. He was unlucky to be just beaten in the Munster National at Limerick in October, and it wasn’t my best day in the saddle when I finished fourth on him in the Paddy Power Chase at Leopardstown over Christmas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/15-randox-grand-national-handicap-803239862-2.jpg><p>But he won nicely at Gowran the last day, and it was no harm that the runner-up came out and won at Fairyhouse there at the weekend.</p><p>You don’t really know how a horse will handle the track or the fences until you get out there, but he had a pop over the National fences at The Curragh, and he went well. I’d be confident that he will take to the fences fine.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>He travels well through his races, which is a big help. You’re just hoping that you can get into a nice position and find a nice racing rhythm over the first few fences.</p><p>I am hopeful that he can. After that, you never know, it’s the Grand National, but he has his chance and I’m very much looking forward to it.</p><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>FREE BETS <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>GET OVER £2,000 IN SIGN UP OFFERS HERE</a></h4><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
