head injury after he was crushed just after 4am.</p><p>It is thought he was crushed between his car and the metal bar of the barrier after it didn't open.</p><p>One airport worker, who began his shift shortly after the accident took place, said: "I got into work at about 6am and we were told that the Terminal Road North was closed.</p><p>"It was a tragic accident, especially at that time of morning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

and gone in front of it.</p><p>"The car has then rolled forward and he's got trapped between the car and the boom."</p><p>A second airport worker, a lady who works in the "Meet and Greet" area, said: "The barrier at the end where you pay has been broken off.</p><p>"The top brass haven't told us anything but the man has clearly got stuck between the barrier and his car."</p><p>This afternoon, the ticket barrier involved in the incident was marked off and awaiting repair.</p><p>The broken boom lay on the floor, while the upright piece that holds the barrier has been bent partly out the ground.</p><p>A cleaner, who was clearing up the area surrounding the broken barrier where the incident took place, said: "What I have been told is that the man left his car in the wrong gear and when he got out of the car it just went forward and hit him and the plastic barrier.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

morning.</p><p>"There was only one man involved and I think he is very badly hurt.</p><p>"I don't understand how this can happen at a simple ticket barrier."</p><p>A Stansted Airport spokesman said: "Essex Police are investigating what happened to the person so they will be able to confirm the findings as and when complete.</p><p>"The barrier was in operation so there were no issues with functionality at the time. The barrier wasn’t removed as the car involved in the incident actually went through it (broke it)."</p><p>Passengers were warned to expect delays as the drop-off area and Terminal Road North was closed, but reopened just after 10am.</p><p>Drivers were being told to drop passengers off in the&nbsp;short stay car park - a short walk from the terminal - instead.</p><p>An Essex police spokesman said: "A driver has been taken to hospital with life threatening injuries following an incident at Stansted Airport.</p><p>"We were called shortly after 4am today, Tuesday, September 25, to reports a 63-year-old man had fallen and become trapped underneath his car in Terminal Road North.</p><p>"The driver, from Waltham Cross, was taken to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge with a head injury.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>"Anyone travelling to the airport is advised Terminal Road North is currently closed so to be aware of disruption."</p><p>A London Stansted Airport spokesperson said: "The express set-down facility is currently closed following an earlier road traffic accident involving a single vehicle.</p><p>"Police have advised that it will remain closed for the next few hours whilst they undertake their investigation.</p><p>"Passengers travelling to the airport by road and intending to use the set-down facility are advised to leave extra time to get to the airport this morning and will be diverted to the Orange Short Stay Car Park upon arrival.</p><p>"Bus transfers from the mid and long stay car parks are operating as normal."</p><p><b>We pay for your stories!
