meaning it's wise to scan every item to see if they can be had for a better price.</p><p>Once you're done shopping, take your items to employees who should give you the lower price at the register if it's not automatically applied already.</p><p>Plus, the store scanner can even reveal hidden clearance if an item doesn't scan on your app.</p><p>Shoppers can also find plenty of deals through the website as Walmart has tons of special deals online.</p><h2><strong>OTHER WAYS TO SAVE</strong></h2><p>There are plenty of other things you can do to save money when shopping at chains like Walmart.</p><p>For one, always buy <a href=#>store-brand items</a> over name brands.</p><p>This is said to save shoppers up to 30 percent.</p><p>Consumers shouldn’t worry about sacrificing the taste of store-brand products compared with prominent brands either.</p><p>A market research study by <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">IRi</a> cited by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ramsey Solutions</a> found that 75 percent of respondents thought the quality of store brand items was just as good as major national ones.</p><p>Loyalty app programs also routinely offer better deals and discounts than you could find on any couponing site.</p><p>Also, there are some third-party apps including Rakuten and Ibotta that allow you to get cash back for purchases you would already make.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Walmart shoppers <a href=#>were recently warned</a> to check their receipts after customers noticed they had been double taxed.</p><p>Plus, here are <a href=#>15 more items</a> marked down to just cents at Walmart, but you’ll need to know how to uncover secret clearance items.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbH12f5dxZ2ivkaG6or7TZpqlnZGnrq%2BvxGagrZ2dqHqxu9KtZKGnnJ6xosWO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./half-eaten-body-found-in-tigers-cage.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Half-eaten body found in tigers cage after zoo visitor jumps in &amp;amp; horrified staff see SHOE in bea</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-sierra-furtado-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Sierra Furtado Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) -
