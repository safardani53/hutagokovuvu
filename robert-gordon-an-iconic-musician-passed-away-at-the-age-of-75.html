Matt Green, VP of Cleopatra Records, stated:</p><p>‚ÄúCleopatra Records extends our heartfelt condolences to his family and friends.‚Äù We enjoyed working with Robert and will miss his strong baritone voice as well as his unwavering passion for his music.‚Äù</p><p>Gordon‚Äôs cause of death was not announced, however, rumors indicate that he had acute myeloid leukemia, and his family set up a GoFundMe campaign to support the expense of treatment.</p><h2>Hellafied, Robert Gordon‚Äôs last album, will be released in November 2022.</h2><p>Robert Gordon, born on March 29, 1947, was significantly influenced by Elvis Presley‚Äôs song Heartbreak Hotel when he was nine years old. He also admired Gene Vincent, Jack Scott, Billy Lee Ridley, and other renowned rock ‚Äòn roll musicians.&nbsp;Gordon made his music debut as the vocalist of the group Confidentials when he was 17 years old, in 1964. He associated with artists like James Brown and Otis Redding, who played in Washington, D.C.‚Äôs Howard Theatre. During the late 1960s riots and antiwar demonstrations in Washington, D.C., he served in the National Guard.</p><p>In 1970, Robert moved to New York City and joined the punk music band Tuff Darts. The band recorded three songs for the Live at CBGB‚Äôs compilation CD. While rehearsing with Tuff Darts, he was seen by record producer Richard Gottehrer, and they considered creating a rock & roll album. Gordon recommended teaming up with guitarist Link Wray, who agreed, resulting in the 1977 collaboration Robert Gordon with Link Wray.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Robert-Gordon-1.jpg alt="Robert Gordon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The record became successful when Elvis Presley died in 1977, and Private Stock Label attempted to market Gordon as Presley‚Äôs successor. Gordon followed up with another album, Fresh Fish Special, in 1978, and was signed to RCA Records the following year. The next year, Gordon released the album Rock Billy Boogie, followed by another, Bad Boy, in 1980. In 1981, he released his last album with the label, Are You Gonna Be The One.</p><p>During the early 1980s, Robert Gordon toured with Danny Gatton, and in the 1990s, he traveled with Chris Spedding in numerous nations. He also toured alongside Spedding in 2005, with highlights from the gigs published on their own label.</p><p>During Elvis‚Äô 30th death anniversary, they also made an album with the Jordanaires that included 15 of Presley‚Äôs songs.&nbsp;Robert also performed on tour with Marco DiMaggio‚Äôs band, Slim Jim Phantom, and Glen Matlock. I‚Äôm Coming Home, his next album, was released in June 2014. He appeared in the 1981 outlaw motorcycle film The Loveless. He was then featured often on television, including on the popular comedy program SCTV. Hellafied, his last album, is planned to be published on November 25th.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Robert-Gordon-2.jpg alt="Robert Gordon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>‚ÄúThis one hurts,‚Äù say netizens of Robert Gordon.</h2><p>In recent years, Robert Gordon has acquired a popularity for his blockbuster albums and songs.
