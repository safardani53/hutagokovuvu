Most recently, he attended his 30th reunion, which he said was about two weeks ago.</p><p>“Really?” host <strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong> asked. “Would you lie? You’re being honest?”</p><p>“I think I would tell you the truth,” Cooper replied, adding that he arrived early to the reunion.</p><p>“What, did you go to the 29th anniversary?” Fallon joked as the pair began hysterically laughing. The A Star Is Born actor continued recounting his milestone reunion, calling it “great” and reiterating his punctuality.</p><p>“I was early, and I put the sign out front. It said ‘Germantown Academy,’” he shared. “And then people came and I welcomed them.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Maestro actor, director and producer</a> continued: “But when I was in high school, I used to go by Brad, and now I go by Bradley. I felt like I was some weird imposter, but that is my real name — Bradley.”</p><p>After graduating high school, Cooper enrolled at Villanova University. He later transferred to Georgetown University, where he graduated in 1997. When Fallon asked Cooper whether people at the reunion “freak” out that he’s now an A-lister, Cooper said no.</p><p>“It was really — it was awesome,” he said. “It was just regular. I think it was just, like, time had passed, and it was just cool. There was a guy [at a reunion] before, and I think I said it here, he was not cool. But he was not there.”</p><p>This is not the first time Cooper’s high school experience has come up on The Tonight Show. In 2018, Cooper recalled one awkward interaction with a former classmate.</p><p>“There was this guy there who was like the best athlete in high school—and he was the nicest guy in high school — and he was so, like, gifted,” Cooper explained. “He was a running back. He was the s–t. He was very good.”</p><p>While noting that his classmate “was pretty inebriated” at the time, Cooper said “he was looking at me like I’ve never seen him look before.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“And he was like, ‘How’d that happen, Brad?’” Cooper said, regarding his success. “I was like, ‘Wait what? How’d what happen?’”</p><p>Cooper told Fallon, “You never know how people are going to react.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpGZuabFjJymqKiVp3qkvsCcoqxlpaV6uLTIpZxmrJGhuKq6xmaYm6elqXqptdJmn6KfmGLApLTOqKNmqpWqu6q7zWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dion-graham.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Dion Graham net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-valentine-thomas-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Valentine Thomas Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
