As a single father who is widowed, Michael’s story drew viewers in as he opened up about the tough time he went through before coming on the show. Now, Michael is a contestant on season 8 of&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bachelor in Paradise</a>, and he’s quickly falling for&nbsp;<strong>Sierra Jackson</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Michael and Sierra formed a connection on night one and have been spending time together on the beach. However, Michael is admittedly guarded when it comes to new relationships, so it remains to be seen how things will play out. Learn more about Michael below:</p><h2>1. Michael Is A Single Dad</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Michael-Allio-5-things-bachelor-in-paradise-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Michael has a 5-year-old son named <strong>James</strong>. Michael revealed that he had a son during the season 17 premiere of The Bachelorette. He also noted that he was allowed to FaceTime with his son while filming the show.</p><h2>2. Michael’s Wife Died</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Michael was married to <strong>Laura Ritter-Allio</strong>. After meeting at Loyola University Chicago, they married in 2012. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017. Laura tragically died in 2019 after a 2-year battle with cancer. He frequently posts about his late wife on social media. In 2020, he wrote a heartfelt post about her. “Came across this beauty earlier today,” he captioned an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram photo</a> of his wife. “It brought me right back to the beach. What a treasure to have spent so much time with someone like her. I miss her every second of every day. It’s likely that you do too.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Michael-Allio-5-things-bachelor-in-paradise-embed2.jpg><h2>3. What Happened To Michael On ‘The Bachelorette’?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Michael and Katie formed a connection on season 17 of&nbsp;The Bachelorette, which filmed in the spring of 2021. They had a one-on-one date during week three, and Michael received the rose. This was when he first opened up to her about what he went through with his wife and her battle with cancer. Michael made it to the final four and was poised to have a hometown date, but <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>self-eliminated</a> from the show after FaceTiming with his son, who was growing increasingly confused about where his father was. Michael knew he had to continue to put his son first and wasn’t ready for love just yet, so he sent himself home.</p><h2>4. What Business Does Michael Own?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Michael created The L4 Project in his late wife’s honor. The <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>organization</a> strives to “enhance existing programs or support new ones that help individuals and families navigate the physical, emotional, institutional and financial complexities that come with a cancer diagnosis so their focus can remain on recovery and living long, happy lives.” In addition to The L4 Project, Michael is the founder of Allstera, according to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn</a>. Allstera is a company that seeks to “deliver quality and affordable sanitation consumer products and personal protective equipment to individuals, companies and organizations of all size.”</p><h2>5. Michael Is Friends With Amanda Kloots</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>After appearing on&nbsp;The Bachelorette, Michael developed a close friendship with&nbsp;<strong>Amanda Kloots</strong>, who is also a widower and single mom. Fans went wild <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>over their friendship</a> when they posted a photo hanging out at the end of 2021. The two were “Instagram friends” for about a year before actually meeting in person, but they both publicly shut down any speculation of a romance between them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K6qq%2FHmpylZZGhuaq7jK2fnmWSlrCpscuoqZ6spJp6dYCSam5yaF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-teeter-leaving-yellowstone.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Teeter Leaving 'Yellowstone'?
