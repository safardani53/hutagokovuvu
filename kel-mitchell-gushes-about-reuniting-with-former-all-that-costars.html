The pair revived their characters Ed and Dexter Reed <a href=#>for the Paramount+ film</a>, which follows the fast-food workers as they fight back against a corporation trying to take over the beloved burger joint.</p><p>“It’s beautiful to be working with my brother all these years in a friendship and also within business as well,” Mitchell told Us of the Saturday Night Live star, also 45. “We are just like, ‘Wow, what a journey.’”</p><p>Mitchell and Thompson’s former costars <strong>Lori Beth Denberg</strong> and <strong>Josh Server</strong> also made guest appearances in the film. “They did an amazing job,” Mitchell shared.</p><p>For Mitchell, it’s surreal that a character he made famous in 1994 has found a new, younger audience. “Kids [who] are 5 or 6 years old have Good Burger parties [and] they weren’t even born then,” he marveled. (Good Burger 2 became Paramount+’s most-watched original film shortly after it premiered on the streaming network.) “It’s great, and it’s a testament to our entire team — the writers, everyone — Kenan and I are both are just enjoying it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kel-Mitchell-Gushes-About-Reuniting-With-Former-All-That-Costars-6.jpg><p>Mitchell’s own children have also become All That fans after catching reruns. The dad of four shares Lyric and Allure with ex <strong>Tyisha Hampton</strong> and Wisdom and Honor — who have minor roles in Good Burger 2 — with wife <strong>Asia Lee</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kel-Mitchell-Gushes-About-Reuniting-With-Former-All-That-Costars-5.jpg><p>“It was just beautiful in that moment to be watching it with my kids, and they’re cracking up laughing,” he said. “The jokes still work!”</p><p>As for whether Mitchell and Thompson — who also teamed up on Kenan & Kel — have plans to join forces again, he hinted they have some “surprises” coming up. “We’re excited,” he added. “We love being a comedy duo.”</p><p>In the meantime, Mitchell is currently focusing on his latest project: teaming up with World Vision Gift Catalog, which allows participants to choose gifts that can make major impacts on struggling families across the world.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kenan-Thompson-Breaks-Down-What-Caused-His-Falling-Out-With-Good-Burger-Costar-Kel-Mitchell-2.jpg><p>“You can donate an alpaca [or] a goat, and that family can actually sell that goat with the milk and take them out of poverty,” he explained. “It’s been really great, and I enjoy doing it. I love working with them and putting a smile on people’s faces.”</p><p>For more information on World Vision Gift Catalog, visit their website <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKepF2itrWvx56jpWWXqsCpsdJmmJunpal6s7HUp6CtoZ6ceri106Fkn6eiorKzecClo2asmJbBbq%2FOrKuaqqNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./miley-cyrus-and-liam-hemsworth-in-black-white.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth in Black, White</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./terry-rooney-baseball-coach.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Terry Rooney (baseball coach) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
