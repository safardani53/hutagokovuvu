Being stuck in the traffic allows you to observe the magnificent beauty of all the ‘trashy citizens’ that live there.”</p><p>Huddersfield, in second place, was branded the "traffic light centre of England".</p><p>People suggested it suffers from <a href=#>crime issues</a> and a struggling high street.</p><p>"Huddersfield should be avoided by all those who desire to keep their wallets, mobile phones, and most of all, their sense of smell," reads one contributor's comment.</p><p>"There’s nothing but pound shops and a few coffee shops.

It makes Slough comparable to the playboy tax exile haven of Monaco."</p><p>In brighter news, the town is set to get a huge cash injection over the next few years.</p><p>It'll be handed £20million from the Government's Levelling Up fund, which will go towards development and regeneration.</p><p>Peterborough, <a href=#>which claimed the top spot for three years running</a>, slipped down to fifth place, while Liverpool was in fouth.</p><p>Bolton in Greater Manchester, Corby in Northamptonshire, Jaywick in Essex, Slough in Berkshire and Bradford in Yorkshire make up the rest of the top 10.</p><p>But some towns say their placement is unfair.</p><p>Even the worst bits of Blackpool are like paradise compared to Jaywick</p><p>Grimsby - 18th on the list - has welcomed new architectural projects and seen dozens of new businesses open recently.</p><p>Matthew Head, who owns The Globe in nearby Cleethorpes, told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GrimsbyLive</a>: "Rankings like this don't get down to the unique opportunities and experiences that are on offer here."</p><p>And he said there's "so much exciting stuff going on" - adding: "I've lived here for four years now and I wouldn't move."</p><p>Leicester, in 32nd place, was labelled "so very woke, dahling" - as other commenters said there were "loads of morons on illegal electric scooters".</p><p>But the town has been on the up for years. It has an international profile thanks to its Premier League team and top-class uni.</p><p>Jaywick in <a href=#>Essex</a> was described as being so bad that "even the worst parts of Blackpool seem like paradise".</p><p>One voter said: "There’s a reason why Ross Kemp visited what he dubbed as ‘Britain’s toughest seaside resort'."</p><p>The village, which has just 5,000 residents, is the most deprived place in the country.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>However, some locals blamed its bad image on the <a href=#>Channel 5 “poverty porn” fly-on-the-wall series Benefits By The Sea.</a></p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>And local councillor Dan Casey&nbsp;told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Clacton Gazette</a> he was "disgusted" by the news.</p><p>"People love living in Jaywick and there is a wonderful community atmosphere here that more affluent places just don't have," he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000525951604.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000703477275.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000703477348.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000703478249.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Couple filmed romping in park by angry walkers as embarrassed couple cover themselves up</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoRzfpRraHFnpKS9boGPZq6oqqOperG4wJycrGWcnsOmecSnnqWZnpl8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-youll-find-in-almost-every-fall-hallmark-channel-movie.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Youll Find in (Almost) Every Fall Hallmark Channel Movie</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mothers-day-2019-gift-baskets-hampers-mum-presents-buy.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mother's Day 2019 gift baskets - the best hampers and sets to buy this Sunday</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
