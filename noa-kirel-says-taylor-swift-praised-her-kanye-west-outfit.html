The Israeli artist noted that Swift also “liked the outfit.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kanye West’s antisemitic tweet</h2><p>West went on a rampage of public appearances and interviews starting in early October, during which he proffered antisemitic remarks and conspiracy theories and criticized Black Lives Matter.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, he was blocked on social media platforms, earning him widespread criticism and disapproval from peers in the industry.</p><p>On October 9, in an apparent misspelling of “DEFCON,” West tweeted that he would go “death con 3 on Jewish people.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kanye West continues his anti-Jewish tirade, discussing how a Jewish doctor intentionally misdiagnosed him & could have killed him.</p><p>He then rants again about Jews controlling entertainment and media, insinuating that the number of Jews in this profession is problematic. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/N2qyoNe8fM</a></p>— Ari Ingel (@OGAride) <a href=# rel=noopener>October 30, 2022</a></figure><p>He asserted in the same post that he cannot be antisemitic since “black people are actually Jew also.”</p><p>The tweet was removed by Twitter hours after it was published because it violated the platform’s policies. Twitter told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a>&nbsp;that because of “a violation of Twitter’s policies,” Twitter locked West’s account.&nbsp;</p><p>The rapper was also banned from using Instagram after he posted a screenshot of a discussion with rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs in which West accused Combs of being under the control of Jews, using a well-known antisemitic cliche.</p><p>Adidas announced that it has “under-reviewed” its relationship with West in light of the latter’s erratic behavior. Forbes estimated that the value of West’s contract with Adidas was $1.5 billion overall and $220 million yearly. The rapper also ended a collaboration with Gap previously.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Breakdown of Taylor Swift’s feud with Kanye West&nbsp;</h2><p>It goes without saying that ‘Love Story’ singer Swift and Kanye West’s relationship is, at best, shaky. At the 2009 MTV VMAs, the rapper cut off Swift’s acceptance speech for Video of the Year, for which he eventually apologized, and the pair’s strained relationship initially made headlines.</p><p>West said, “Yo, Taylor, I’m really happy for you, I’m a let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>A day after the event, the ‘Wash in the Blood’ singer claimed that the outburst was caused by a combination of “sincerity and booze” on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ellen Show</a>&nbsp;and stated he wanted to apologize to her in person.</p><p>Swift revealed on September 15, 2009, that the hip-pop star had called to apologize after a few days. When the artist called, she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC Radio</a>&nbsp;that he was pretty honest in his apologies and that she had accepted it.</p><p>A year after the incident, the&nbsp;Midnights&nbsp;artist performed ‘Innocent’ at the 2010 MTV VMAs, which was rumored to be about West.&nbsp;</p><p>The lyrics were, “It’s all right / Just wait and see / Your string of lights is still bright to me / Who you are is not where you’ve been / You’re still an innocent.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>On June 16, 2013, the rapper took back his apology to Swift. At the time, he asserted that he did not have one regret to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>He added, “If anyone’s reading this waiting for some type of full-on, flat apology for anything, they should just stop reading right now.”</p><p>West, on February 9, 2016, launched ‘Famous,’ at his Yeezy Show. It featured a jab at Swift. However, she slammed him by delivering a super-empowering speech during her 2016 Grammy Awards acceptance speech.</p><p>Swift expressed that as the first woman to receive an album of the year at the Grammys twice, she wanted to convey to all the young women out there that there would be others who wish to undermine your success along the way.</p><p class=has-small-font-size><strong>Keep reading <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Glamour Buff</a> for more stories like this!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57xLGapa2jnsOme82omGajmaeyrXnSmrCsZaSWxq270WaqsKGWqXqxvsCiqp6cXZ2ys3nKmqWynV2ssrTAjKisrZ6ZqXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./simon-cowell-engaged-to-his-girlfriend-lauren-silverman.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Simon Cowell Engaged To His Girlfriend Lauren Silverman</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./new-portrait-king-charles-queen-consort-prince-princess-of-wales-revealed.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>New Portraits of King Charles, The Queen Consort Revealed</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
