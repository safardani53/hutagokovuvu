means a better chance at conceiving.</p><p>He highlighted a study published in 2017 in Fertil Steril which revealed that couples who had sex every other day had a better chance at conceiving than those who had sex just once a week.</p><p>Dr Eisenberg said: "Avoid making sexual activity an obligation and try to make it pleasurable, rather than a chore."</p><p>He said that the timing of when you have sex is also another thing to consider.</p><p>"The peak of fertility can vary even in women with regular cycles.&nbsp;One way of predicting ovulation is through vaginal secretion analysis.</p><p>"When it's slippery and clear, the probability of conception is highest. Ovulation predictor kits or cycle tracking can also help", Dr Eisenberg said.</p><h2>Moderate your vices</h2><p>If you're pregnant it's advised you cut out alcohol, booze and tobacco anyway so if you're trying to conceive, Dr Eisenberg says you should moderate booze and caffeine and avoid tobacco altogether.</p><p>He said: "Women trying to get pregnant should avoid drinking more than two drinks a day (10g of alcohol).</p><p>"High levels of caffeine consumption (more than 5 cups of coffee per day) have also been associated with decreased fertility.&nbsp;</p><p>"Finally, people who smoke are more likely to have fertility issues", he said.</p><h2>Use lube</h2><p>While this might seem like a strange one, specialists recommend using mineral oil, canola oil, or hydroxyethyl cellulose-based lubricants when necessary.</p><p>This is because some water-based vaginal lubricants may decrease sperm movements due to the chemical composition, Dr Eisenberg explained.</p><p>While these are the main ways you can help up your chances of conceiving, Dr Eisenberg said you also want to maximise the chance of the sperm making it's way to the egg.</p><p>He said: "It is a common misconception that only a single sperm is needed to reach the egg for fertilisation to occur.&nbsp;</p><p>"In fact, successful fertilisation requires many sperm to prepare the way for the final 'survivor’.&nbsp;</p><p>"For that to happen, a few million sperm cells need to reach the uterus. However, most sperm cells that remain in the vaginal tract after sex can't survive in the vagina's acidic environment”.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>He said you can use a 'sperm guide' which aims to increase the chances of natural conception by avoiding semen leakage during sex.</p><p>Devices like twoplus are said to help guide sperm to the right place as the device mimics cervical cap insemination, preventing leakage of sperm after sex, while also increasing the amount of sperm which reaches the cervical mucus.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Mum-to-be shares the symptoms of pregnancy nobody talks about</span><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxygpdrbmlqYWSzpr7ToqOirKlisbCv06ipZqyZpcBur86nmp6hppp8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./model-alexandra-crandell-previously-dated-adam-senn-what-about-her-current-relationship-stature.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Model Alexandra Crandell Previously Dated Adam Senn, What About Her Current Relationship Stature?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sophie-turner-x-men-dark-phoenix-press-outfits-3620792.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dark Phoenix Press Outfits Pics Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marilyn-manson-gay-html.html>How Being Perceived as Gay Shaped Marilyn Manson's Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jayden-cole-19851009-html.html>Jayden Cole (Other) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rita-ora-bikini-after-revealing-new-tattoo.html>Rita Ora looks incredible as she sunbathes in patterned bikini after revealing her latest tattoo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jaye-cane-dating.html>Who is Jaye Cane Dating Now</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-kostya-tszyu-dating.html>Who is Kostya Tszyu Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog.
