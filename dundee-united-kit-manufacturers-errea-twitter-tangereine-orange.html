No, we play in tangerine."</p><p>While another, offering a more positive perspective, said: "*Tangerine. Looks great!"</p><p>But a response from Erreà to one reply stood out above all others, with the manufacturers getting on the defensive.</p><p>A supported commented: "Should be tangerine. Not orange. At least get the colour right!</p><p>"Plus, we didn't start playing in tangerine till 1966. Not off to a good start with 2 important stats incorrect!"</p><p>Erreà seemed to get the claws out for their comeback.</p><p>The brand said: "Sorry for the two inaccuracies James, we will improve so that everything will be perfect next time thanks to your valuable advice.</p><p>"Congratulations you are a big fan of your club.

That looks absolutely SENSATIONAL with no sponsor."</p><p>Another commented: "Going to be heartbreaking watching them plaster sponsors all over this masterpiece."</p><p>"Looks unreal without the sponsor on it," came a further reply, and many after it...</p><p>United's head of commercial and sponsorship, Elliot Shaw, said: "I am absolutely delighted how our maiden kit of the Errea era has turned out.</p><p>"The design is stylish and contemporary, and I have no doubts that it will be a real hit with our supporters.</p><p>"I am also thrilled to introduce Bartercard as our new front-of-shirt sponsor for the 2023/24 season.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"Bartercard have been a fantastic partner to work with, and it is great to see how our initial conversations last summer around partnering with the club have developed at such a pace that they are now Principal Partners.
